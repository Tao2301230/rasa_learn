Added the new dialogue policy RulePolicy which will replace the old “rule-like”
policies [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy),
[Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy),
[Two-Stage Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#two-stage-fallback-policy), and
[Form Policy](./policies.mdx#form-policy). These policies are now
deprecated and will be removed in the future. Please see the
[rules documentation](./rules.mdx) for more information.

Added new NLU component [FallbackClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#fallbackclassifier) 
which predicts an intent `nlu_fallback` in case the confidence was below a given
threshold. The intent `nlu_fallback` may
then be used to write stories / rules to handle the fallback in case of low NLU
confidence.

```python
pipeline:
- ... # Other NLU components
- name: FallbackClassifier
  # If the highest ranked intent has a confidence lower than the threshold then
  # the NLU pipeline predicts an intent `nlu_fallback` which you can then be used in
  # stories / rules to implement an appropriate fallback.
  threshold: 0.5
```
