You can now enable threaded message responses from Rasa through the Slack connector. 
This option is enabled using an optional configuration in the credentials.yml file

```yaml
    slack:
      slack_token:
      slack_channel:
      use_threads: True
```

Button support has also been added in the Slack connector.
