We updated the way how we save and use features in our NLU pipeline.

The message object now has a dedicated field, called `features`, to store the
features that are generated in the NLU pipeline. We adapted all our featurizers in a
way that sequence and sentence features are stored independently. This allows us to
keep different kind of features for the sequence and the sentence. For example, the
`LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer` does not produce any sentence features anymore as our
experiments showed that those did not bring any performance gain just quite a lot of
additional values to store.

We also modified the DIET architecture to process the sequence and sentence
features independently at first. The features are concatenated just before
the transformer.

We also removed the `__CLS__` token again. Our Tokenizers will not
add this token anymore.
