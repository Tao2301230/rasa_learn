The conversation event `form` was renamed to `active_loop`. Rasa Open Source
will continue to be able to read and process old `form` events. Note that 
serialized trackers will no longer have the `active_form` field. Instead the 
`active_loop` field will contain the same information. Story representations
in Markdown and YAML will use `active_loop` instead of `form` to represent the
event.
