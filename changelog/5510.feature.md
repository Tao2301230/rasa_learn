You can now define what kind of features should be used by what component
(see [Choosing a Pipeline](./tuning-your-model.mdx)).

You can set an alias via the option `alias` for every featurizer in your pipeline.
The `alias` can be anything, by default it is set to the full featurizer class name.
You can then specify, for example, on the
[DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#diet-classifier) what features from which
featurizers should be used.
If you don't set the option `featurizers` all available features will be used.
This is also the default behavior.
Check components to see what components have the option
`featurizers` available.

Here is an example pipeline that shows the new option.
We define an alias for all featurizers in the pipeline.
All features will be used in the `DIETClassifier`.
However, the `ResponseSelector` only takes the features from the
`ConveRTFeaturizer` and the `CountVectorsFeaturizer` (word level).

```
pipeline:
- name: ConveRTTokenizer
- name: ConveRTFeaturizer
  alias: "convert"
- name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  alias: "cvf_word"
- name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  alias: "cvf_char"
  analyzer: char_wb
  min_ngram: 1
  max_ngram: 4
- name: RegexFeaturizer
  alias: "regex"
- name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
  alias: "lsf"
- name: DIETClassifier:
- name: ResponseSelector
  epochs: 50
  featurizers: ["convert", "cvf_word"]
- name: EntitySynonymMapper
```
