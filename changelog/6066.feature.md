The NLU `interpreter` is now passed to the [Policies](./policies.mdx) during training and
inference time. Note that this requires an additional parameter `interpreter` in the
method `predict_action_probabilities` of the `Policy` interface. In case a
custom `Policy` implementation doesn't provide this parameter Rasa Open Source
will print a warning and omit passing the `interpreter`.
