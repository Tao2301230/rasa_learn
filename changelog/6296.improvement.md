* Modified functionality of `SingleStateFeaturizer`. 
  
  `SingleStateFeaturizer` uses trained NLU `Interpreter` to featurize intents and action names.
  This modified `SingleStateFeaturizer` can replicate `LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` functionality.
  This component is deprecated from now on. 
  To replicate `LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` functionality,
  add a `Tokenizer`  with `intent_tokenization_flag: True` and `CountVectorsFeaturizer` to the NLU pipeline.
  Please update your configuration file.

  For example:
    ```yaml
    language: en
    pipeline:
      - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
        intent_tokenization_flag: True
      - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
    ``` 

  Please train both NLU and Core (using `rasa train`) to use a trained tokenizer and featurizer for core featurization.  

  The new `SingleStateFeaturizer` stores slots, entities and forms in sparse features for more lightweight storage. 

  `BinarySingleStateFeaturizer` is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  We recommend to switch to `SingleStateFeaturizer`.

* Modified `TEDPolicy` to handle sparse features. As a result, `TEDPolicy` may require more epochs than before to converge. 

* Default TEDPolicy featurizer changed to `MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer` with infinite max history (takes all dialogue turns into account).
* Default batch size for TED increased from [8,32] to [64, 256]
