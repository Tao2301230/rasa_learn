`LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` is deprecated. To replicate `LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer` functionality,
add a `Tokenizer`  with `intent_tokenization_flag: True` and `CountVectorsFeaturizer` to the NLU pipeline.
An example of elements to be added to the pipeline is shown in the improvement changelog 6296`. 


 `BinarySingleStateFeaturizer` is deprecated and will be removed in the future. We recommend to switch to `SingleStateFeaturizer`.
