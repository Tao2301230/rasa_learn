## Quick Installation

You can install Rasa Open Source using pip (requires Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8).

<!-- TODO: REMOVE VERSION NUMBER FOR RASA 2.0 RELEASE -->
```bash
pip3 install rasa==2.0.0a2
```

You are now ready to go! So what's next?
You can create a new project by running

```bash
rasa init
```

:::note Want to explore first?
You can explore Rasa Open Source online using our prototyper without any installation.
At the end of the tutorial you can download the resulting assistant, install Rasa on
your machine and continue development locally.

## Step-by-step Installation Guide

Prefer following video instructions? Watch our installation series on
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL75e0qA87dlEWUA5ToqLLR026wIkk2evk),
it explains the installation in walkthroughs for all major platforms.

### 1. Python Environment Setup

Check if your Python environment is already configured:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If these packages are already installed, these commands should display version
numbers for each step, and you can skip to the next step.

Otherwise, proceed with the instructions below to install them.

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Ubuntu", "value": "ubuntu"}, {"label": "macOS", "value": "macos"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]}  groupId="operating-systems" defaultValue="ubuntu">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

  Fetch the relevant packages using `apt`, and install virtualenv using `pip`.

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

  Install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager if you haven't already.

  Once you're done, you can install Python3.

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew install python
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

  Make sure the Microsoft VC++ Compiler is installed, so python can compile
  any dependencies. You can get the compiler from <a className="reference external"
  href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/"
  target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>. Download the installer and select
  VC++ Build tools in the list.Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (64-bit version) for Windows.

  ```bat
  C:\> pip3 install -U pip
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Virtual Environment Setup

This step is optional, but we strongly recommend isolating python projects
using virtual environments. Tools like
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provide
isolated Python environments, which are cleaner than installing packages system-wide
(as they prevent dependency conflicts). They also let you install packages
without root privileges.

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Ubuntu", "value": "ubuntu"}, {"label": "macOS", "value": "macos"}, {"label": "Windows", "value": "windows"}]}  groupId="operating-systems" defaultValue="ubuntu">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `./venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `./venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

  Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a `.\\venv` directory to hold it:

  ```bat
  C:\> python3 -m venv ./venv
  ```

  Activate the virtual environment:

  ```bat
  C:\> .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Install Rasa Open Source

<Tabs values={[{"label": "Ubuntu / macOS / Windows", "value": "ubuntu/macos/windows"}]} defaultValue="ubuntu/macos/windows">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu/macos/windows">

  First make sure your `pip` version is up to date:

  ```bash
  pip3 install -U pip
  ```

  To install Rasa Open Source:

  ```bash
  pip3 install rasa
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Congratulations! You have successfully installed Rasa Open Source!**

Next step: Start prototyping your first assistant online and download it afterwards

## Building from Source

If you want to use the development version of Rasa Open Source, you can get it from GitHub:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
git clone https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa.git
cd rasa
poetry install
```

## Additional Dependencies

For some machine learning algorithms you need to install additional python packages.
They aren't installed by default to keep the footprint small.

The page on [Tuning Your Model](./tuning-your-model.mdx) will help you pick the right
configuration for your assistant and alert you to additional dependencies.

:::tip Just give me everything!
If you don't mind the additional dependencies lying around, you can use

```bash
pip3 install rasa[full]
```

to install all needed dependencies for every configuration.

### Dependencies for spaCy

For more information on spaCy, check out the [spaCy docs](https://spacy.io/usage/models).

You can install it with the following commands:

```bash
pip3 install rasa[spacy]
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python3 -m spacy link en_core_web_md en
```

This will install Rasa Open Source as well as spaCy and its language model
for the English language. We recommend using at least the
“medium” sized models (`_md`) instead of the spaCy's
default small `en_core_web_sm` model. Small models require less
memory to run, but will somewhat reduce intent classification performance.

### Dependencies for MITIE

First, run

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE.git
pip3 install rasa[mitie]
```

and then download the
[MITIE models](https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE/releases/download/v0.4/MITIE-models-v0.2.tar.bz2).
The file you need is `total_word_feature_extractor.dat`. Save this
anywhere. If you want to use MITIE, you need to
tell it where to find this file (in this example it was saved in the
`data` folder of the project directory).
