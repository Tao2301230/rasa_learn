Responses are the simplest type of action, which utter a response you define in your
domain file, starting with `utter_`:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_my_message:
    - text: "This is what I want my action to say!"
```


:::note
If you want to change the text, or any other part of the bots response,
you need to retrain the assistant before these changes will be picked up.

## Using Responses

Responses are messages the bot will send back to the user. There are
two ways to use these responses:

1. So long as the name of the response starts with `utter_`, the response can
   directly be used as an action. You would add the response
   to the domain:

   ```yaml-rasa
   responses:
     utter_greet:
     - text: "Hey! How are you?"
   ```

   Afterwards, you can use the response as an action in the
   stories:

   ```yaml-rasa
   stories:
   - story: greet user
     steps:
     - intent: greet
     - action: utter_greet
   ```

   When `utter_greet` is run as an action, it will send the message from
   the response back to the user.

2. You can use the responses to generate response messages from your
   custom actions using the dispatcher:
   `dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet")`.
   This allows you to separate the logic of generating
   the messages from the actual copy. In your custom action code, you can
   send a message based on the response like this:

   ```python
   from rasa_sdk.actions import Action

   class ActionGreet(Action):
     def name(self):
         return 'action_greet'

     def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
         dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet")
         return []
   ```

## Rich Responses

A response can be as simple as some text, or can include variation, visual
and interactive components, and more.

### Images and Buttons

Responses defined in a domain's yaml file can contain images and
buttons as well:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
    buttons:
    - title: "great"
      payload: "great"
    - title: "super sad"
      payload: "super sad"
  utter_cheer_up:
  - text: "Here is something to cheer you up:"
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
```

It's common to use buttons as a shortcut to bypass NLU.
Rasa Open Source will send messages starting with a `/` to the
`RegexInterpreter`, which expects NLU input in the same format
as in story files, e.g. `/intent{entities}`. For example, if you let
users choose a color by clicking a button, the button payloads may look like:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_ask_color:
  - text: "what color would you like?"
    buttons:
    - title: "blue"
      payload: '/choose{"color": "blue"}'
    - title: "red"
      payload: '/choose{"color": "red"}'
```


:::note
Please keep in mind that it is up to the implementation of the output
channel on how to display the defined buttons. The command line, for
example, can't display buttons or images, but tries to mimic them by
printing the options.

:::

### Custom Output Payloads

You can also send any arbitrary output to the output channel using the
`custom:` key. Note that since the domain is in yaml format, the json
payload should first be converted to yaml format.

For example, although date pickers are not a defined parameter in responses
because they are not supported by most channels, a Slack date picker
can be sent like so:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_take_bet:
  - custom:
      blocks:
      - type: section
        text:
          text: "Make a bet on when the world will end:"
          type: mrkdwn
        accessory:
          type: datepicker
          initial_date: '2019-05-21'
          placeholder:
            type: plain_text
            text: Select a date
```

### Channel-Specific Responses

For each response, you can have multiple **response variations** (see [Variations](./domain.mdx#variations)).
If you have certain response variations that you would like sent only to specific
channels, you can specify this with the `channel:` key. The value should match
the name defined in the `name()` method of the channel's `OutputChannel`
class. Channel-specific responses are especially useful if creating custom
output payloads that will only work in certain channels.

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_ask_game:
  - text: "Which game would you like to play?"
    channel: "slack"
    custom:
        blocks:
        - type: actions
          elements:
          - type: button
            text:
              type: plain_text
              emoji: true
              text: "Chess :crown:"
            value: '/inform{"game": "chess"}'
          - type: button
            text:
              type: plain_text
              emoji: true
              text: "Checkers :checkered_flag:"
            value: '/inform{"game": "checkers"}'
          - type: button
            text:
              type: plain_text
              emoji: true
              text: "Fortnite :european_castle:"
            value: '/inform{"game": "fortnite"}'
            style: danger
  - text: "Which game would you like to play?"
    buttons:
    - title: "Chess"
      payload: '/inform{"game": "chess"}'
    - title: "Checkers"
      payload: '/inform{"game": "checkers"}'
    - title: "Fortnite"
      payload: '/inform{"game": "fortnite"}'
```

Each time your bot looks for responses, it will first check to see if there
are any channel-specific response variations for the connected channel. If there are, it
will choose **only** from these response variations. If no channel-specific response variations are
found, it will choose from any response variations that do not have a defined `channel`.
Therefore, it is good practice to always have at least one response variation for each
response that has no `channel` specified so that your bot can respond in all
environments, including in the shell and in interactive learning.

### Variables

You can also use **variables** in your responses to insert information
collected during the dialogue. You can either do that in your custom python
code or by using the automatic slot filling mechanism. For example, if you
have a response like this:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"
```

Rasa will automatically fill that variable with a value found in a slot called
`name`.

In custom code, you can retrieve a response by using:

```python
from rasa_sdk.actions import Action

class ActionCustom(Action):
   def name(self):
      return "action_custom"

   def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
      # send utter default response to user
      dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_default")
      # ... other code
      return []
```

If the response contains variables denoted with `{my_variable}`
you can supply values for the fields by passing them as keyword
arguments to `utter_message`:

```python
dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet", my_variable="my text")
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="variations"></a>

### Response Variations

If you want to randomly vary the response sent to the user, you can list
multiple **response variations** and Rasa will randomly pick one of them, e.g.:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_greeting:
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How is your day going?"
```
