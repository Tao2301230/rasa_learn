NLU training data is structured into different parts:

* training examples

* synonyms

* regex features and

* lookup tables

While training examples is the only part that is mandatory, including the others will help the NLU model
learn the domain with fewer examples and also help it be more confident of its predictions.

Synonyms will map extracted entities to the same name, for example mapping “my savings account” to simply “savings”.
However, this only happens *after* the entities have been extracted, so you need to provide examples with the synonyms
present so that Rasa can learn to pick them up.

Lookup tables are lists of words used to generate
case-insensitive regex patterns that are added to the regex features.

:::note
The common theme here is that training examples, regex features and lookup tables merely act as cues to the final NLU
model by providing additional features to the machine learning algorithm during training. Therefore, it must not be
assumed that having a single example would be enough for the model to robustly identify intents and/or entities
across all variants of that example.

`/` symbol is reserved as a delimiter to separate retrieval intents from response text identifiers. Make sure not
to use it in the name of your intents.

## Improving Intent Classification and Entity Recognition

### Regular Expression Features (regex)

For example, the names of German streets often end in `strasse`. By adding this as a regex,
we are telling the model to pay attention to words ending this way, and will quickly learn to
associate that with a location entity.


Regular expressions can be used in two different ways:

1. They can be used to support the intent classification and entity extraction when using the [RegexFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#regexfeaturizer) component in the pipeline.
   Each of the regexes then provide the intent classifier or entity extractor with an extra binary feature, which says if the regex was found or not.

2. They can be used to directly extract entities from a user messages when using the [RegexEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#regexentityextractor) component in the pipeline.

For example, if your entity has a deterministic structure (like a zipcode or an email address), you can use a regular
expression to ease detection of that entity (using the [RegexFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#regexfeaturizer)) or to directly extract the entities from
the user message (using the [RegexEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#regexentityextractor)). 


In case you are using the regular expressions for the [RegexFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#regexfeaturizer) the name of the regular expression does
not matter. If does not define the entity nor the intent, it is just a human readable description for you to remember
what this regex is used for and is the title of the corresponding pattern feature.
If you want to use the [RegexFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#regexfeaturizer) you can also use the regex features to improve the intent
classification performance, for example, by defining a greet clause:


If you are using the regular expressions to directly extract entities using the [RegexEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#regexentityextractor),
the name of the regular expression should match the name of the entity you want to extract.

Try to create your regular expressions in a way that they match as few words as possible. E.g. using `hey[^\\s]*`
instead of `hey.\*`, as the later one might match the whole message whereas the first one only matches a single word.

When using the [RegexFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#regexfeaturizer), the regex features for entity extraction are currently only supported by the
`CRFEntityExtractor` and the `DIETClassifier` component! Hence, other entity extractors, like
`MitieEntityExtractor` or `SpacyEntityExtractor` won't use the generated features and their
presence will not improve entity recognition for these extractors. Currently, all intent classifiers make use of
available regex features.

:::note
Regex features only define entities when used in combination with the [RegexEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#regexentityextractor).
Otherwise they don't define entities nor intents! They simply provide patterns to help the classifier
recognize entities and related intents. Hence, you still need to provide intent & entity examples as part of your
training data!

### Entities Roles and Groups

:::caution
This feature is experimental.
We introduce experimental features to get feedback from our community, so we encourage you to try it out!
However, the functionality might be changed or removed in the future.
If you have feedback (positive or negative) please share it with us on the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com).

Assigning custom entity labels to words, allow you to define certain concepts in the data.
For example, we can define what a city is:

```
I want to fly from [Berlin]{"entity": "city"} to [San Francisco]{"entity": "city"} .
```

However, sometimes you want to specify entities even further.
Let's assume we want to build an assistant that should book a flight for us.
The assistant needs to know which of the two cities in the example above is the departure city and which is the
destination city.
`Berlin` and `San Francisco` are still cities, but they play a different role in our example.
To distinguish between the different roles, you can assign a role label in addition to the entity label.

```
- I want to fly from [Berlin]{"entity": "city", "role": "departure"} to [San Francisco]{"entity": "city", "role": "destination"}.
```

You can also group different entities by specifying a group label next to the entity label.
The group label can, for example, be used to define different orders.
In the following example we use the group label to reference what toppings goes with which pizza and
what size which pizza has.

```
Give me a [small]{"entity": "size", "group": "1"} pizza with [mushrooms]{"entity": "topping", "group": "1"} and
a [large]{"entity": "size", "group": "2"} [pepperoni]{"entity": "topping", "group": "2"}
```

See [Training Data Format](training-data-format.mdx#entities) for details on how to define entities with roles and groups in your training data.

The entity object returned by the extractor will include the detected role/group label.

```json
{
  "text": "Book a flight from Berlin to SF",
  "intent": "book_flight",
  "entities": [
    {
      "start": 19,
      "end": 25,
      "value": "Berlin",
      "entity": "city",
      "role": "departure",
      "extractor": "DIETClassifier",
    },
    {
      "start": 29,
      "end": 31,
      "value": "San Francisco",
      "entity": "city",
      "role": "destination",
      "extractor": "DIETClassifier",
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
Composite entities are currently only supported by the [DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier) and [CRFEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#crfentityextractor).

:::

In order to properly train your model with entities that have roles/groups, make sure to include enough training data
examples for every combination of entity and role/group label.
Also make sure to have some variations in your training data, so that the model is able to generalize.
For example, you should not only have example like `fly FROM x TO y`, but also include examples like
`fly TO y FROM x`.

To fill slots from entities with a specific role/group, you need to either define a custom slot mappings using
[Forms](forms.mdx) or use [Custom Actions](custom-actions.mdx) to extract the corresponding entity directly from the tracker.
