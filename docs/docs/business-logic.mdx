A lot of conversational assistants have user goals that involve collecting a bunch of information
from the user before being able to do something for them. This is called slot filling. For
example, in the banking industry you may have a user goal of transferring money, where you
need to collect information about which account to transfer from, whom to transfer to and the
amount to transfer. This type of behavior can and should be handled in a rule based way, as it
is clear how this information should be collected.

For this type of use case, we can use Forms and our FormPolicy. The [FormPolicy](./policies.mdx#form-policy)
works by predicting the form as the next action until all information is gathered from the user.

As an example, we will build out the SalesForm from Sara. The user wants to contact
our sales team, and for this we need to gather the following pieces of information:

* Their job

* Their bot use case

* Their name

* Their email

* Their budget

* Their company

We will start by defining the `SalesForm` as a new class in the file called `actions.py`.
The first method we need to define is the name, which like in a regular Action
returns the name that will be used in our stories:

```python
from rasa_sdk.forms import FormAction

class SalesForm(FormAction):
    """Collects sales information and adds it to the spreadsheet"""

    def name(self):
        return "sales_form"
```

Next we have to define the `required_slots` method which specifies which pieces of information to
ask for, i.e. which slots to fill.

```python
@staticmethod
def required_slots(tracker):
    return [
        "job_function",
        "use_case",
        "budget",
        "person_name",
        "company",
        "business_email",
        ]
```

Note: you can customize the required slots function not to be static. E.g. if the `job_function` is a
developer, you could add a `required_slot` about the users experience level with Rasa

Once you've done that, you'll need to specify how the bot should ask for this information. This
is done by specifying `utter_ask_{slotname}` responses in your `domain.yml` file. For the above
we'll need to specify the following:

```yaml
utter_ask_business_email:
  - text: What's your business email?
utter_ask_company:
  - text: What company do you work for?
utter_ask_budget:
  - text: "What's your annual budget for conversational AI? 💸"
utter_ask_job_function:
  - text: "What's your job? 🕴"
utter_ask_person_name:
  - text: What's your name?
utter_ask_use_case:
  - text: What's your use case?
```

We'll also need to define all these slots in our `domain.yml` file:

```yaml
slots:
  company:
    type: unfeaturized
  job_function:
    type: unfeaturized
  person_name:
    type: unfeaturized
  budget:
    type: unfeaturized
  business_email:
    type: unfeaturized
  use_case:
    type: unfeaturized
```

Going back to our Form definition, we need to define the `submit` method as well,
which will do something with the information the user has provided once the form is complete:

```python
def submit(
    self,
    dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
    tracker: Tracker,
    domain: Dict[Text, Any],
) -> List[Dict]:

    dispatcher.utter_message("Thanks for getting in touch, we'll contact you soon")
    return []
```

In this case, we only tell the user that we'll be in touch with them, however
usually you would send this information to an API or a database. See the [rasa-demo](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/actions/actions.py#L148)
for an example of how to store this information in a spreadsheet.

We'll need to add the form we just created to a new section in our `domain.yml` file:

```yaml
forms:
  - sales_form
```

We also need to create an intent to activate the form, as well as an intent for providing all the
information the form asks the user for. For the form activation intent, we can create an
intent called `contact_sales`. Add the following training data to your nlu file:

```md
## intent:contact_sales
- I wanna talk to your sales people.
- I want to talk to your sales people
- I want to speak with sales
- Sales
- Please schedule a sales call
- Please connect me to someone from sales
- I want to get in touch with your sales guys
- I would like to talk to someone from your sales team
- sales please
```

You can view the full intent [here](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/data/nlu/nlu.md#intentcontact_sales))

We will also create an intent called `inform` which covers any sort of information the user
provides to the bot. *The reason we put all this under one intent, is because there is no
real intent behind providing information, only the entity is important.* Add the following
data to your NLU file:

```md
## intent:inform
- [100k](budget)
- [100k](budget)
- [240k/year](budget)
- [150,000 USD](budget)
- I work for [Rasa](company)
- The name of the company is [ACME](company)
- company: [Rasa Technologies](company)
- it's a small company from the US, the name is [Hooli](company)
- it's a tech company, [Rasa](company)
- [ACME](company)
- [Rasa Technologies](company)
- [maxmeier@firma.de](business_email)
- [bot-fan@bots.com](business_email)
- [maxmeier@firma.de](business_email)
- [bot-fan@bots.com](business_email)
- [my email is email@rasa.com](business_email)
- [engineer](job_function)
- [brand manager](job_function)
- [marketing](job_function)
- [sales manager](job_function)
- [growth manager](job_function)
- [CTO](job_function)
- [CEO](job_function)
- [COO](job_function)
- [John Doe](person_name)
- [Jane Doe](person_name)
- [Max Mustermann](person_name)
- [Max Meier](person_name)
- We plan to build a [sales bot](use_case) to increase our sales by 500%.
- we plan to build a [sales bot](use_case) to increase our revenue by 100%.
- a [insurance tool](use_case) that consults potential customers on the best life insurance to choose.
- we're building a [conversational assistant](use_case) for our employees to book meeting rooms.
```

:::note
Entities like `business_email` and `budget` would usually be handled by pretrained entity extractors
(e.g. [DucklingHTTPExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#ducklinghttpextractor)
or [SpacyEntityExtractor](./components/entity-extractors.mdx#spacyentityextractor)), but for this tutorial
we want to avoid any additional setup.

:::

The intents and entities will need to be added to your `domain.yml` file as well:

```yaml
intents:
  - greet
  - bye
  - thank
  - faq
  - contact_sales
  - inform

entities:
  - company
  - job_function
  - person_name
  - budget
  - business_email
  - use_case
```

A story for a form is very simple, as all the slot collection form happens inside the form, and
therefore doesn't need to be covered in your stories. You just need to write a single story showing when the form should be activated. For the sales form, add this story
to your `stories.md` file:

```md
## sales form
* contact_sales
    - sales_form                   <!--Run the sales_form action-->
    - active_loop{"name": "sales_form"}   <!--Activate the form-->
    - active_loop{"name": null}           <!--Deactivate the form-->
```

As a final step, let's add the FormPolicy to our config file:

```yaml
policies:
  - name: MemoizationPolicy
  - name: TEDPolicy
  - name: MappingPolicy
  - name: FormPolicy
```

At this point, you already have a working form, so let's try it out. Make sure to uncomment the
`action_endpoint` in your `endpoints.yml` to make Rasa aware of the action server that will run our form:

```yaml
action_endpoint:
 url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"
```

Then start the action server in a new terminal window:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

Then you can retrain and talk to your bot:

```bash
rasa train
rasa shell
```

This simple form will work out of the box, however you will likely want to add a bit
more capability to handle different situations. One example of this is validating
slots, to make sure the user provided information correctly (read more about it
[here](./forms.mdx#validating-user-input)).

Another example is that you may want to fill slots from things other than entities
of the same name. E.g. for the “use case” situation in our Form, we would expect
the user to type a full sentence and not something that you could necessarily
extract as an entity. In this case we can make use of the `slot_mappings` method,
where you can describe what your entities should be extracted from. Here we can
use the `from_text` method to extract the users whole message:

```python
def slot_mappings(self) -> Dict[Text, Union[Dict, List[Dict[Text, Any]]]]:
    """A dictionary to map required slots to
    - an extracted entity
    - intent: value pairs
    - a whole message
    or a list of them, where a first match will be picked"""
    return {"use_case": self.from_text(intent="inform")}
```

Now our bot will extract the full user message when asking for the use case slot,
and we don't need to use the `use_case` entity defined before.

All of the methods within a form can be customized to handle different branches in your
business logic. Read more about this [here](./forms.mdx).
However, you should make sure not to handle any unhappy paths inside the form. These
should be handled by writing regular stories, so your model can learn this behavior.

:::note
Here's a minimal checklist of files we modified to handle business logic using a form action:

* `actions.py`: Define the form action, including the `required_slots`, `slot_mappings` and `submit` methods

* `data/nlu.yml`:

    * Add examples for an intent to activate the form

    * Add examples for an `inform` intent to fill the form

* `domain.yml`:

    * Add all slots required by the form

    * Add `utter_ask_{slot}` responses for all required slots

    * Add your form action to the `forms` section

    * Add all intents and entities from your NLU training data

* `data/stories.yml`: Add a story for the form

* `config.yml`:

    * Add the `FormPolicy` to your policies

    * Add entity extractors to your pipeline

* `endpoints.yml`: Define the `action_endpoint`
