## Message Handling

This diagram shows the basic steps of how an assistant built with Rasa
responds to a message:



<img alt="image" src={useBaseUrl("/img/rasa-message-processing.png")} />

The steps are:

1. The message is received and passed to an `Interpreter`, which
   converts it into a dictionary including the original text, the intent,
   and any entities that were found. This part is handled by NLU.

2. The `Tracker` is the object which keeps track of conversation state.
   It receives the info that a new message has come in.

3. The policy receives the current state of the tracker.

4. The policy chooses which action to take next.

5. The chosen action is logged by the tracker.

6. A response is sent to the user.

:::note
Messages can be text typed by a human, or structured input
like a button press.
