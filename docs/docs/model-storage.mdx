Rasa can load your model in three different ways:

1. Fetch the model from a server (see [Fetching Models from a Server](./model-storage.mdx#server-fetch-from-server)), or

2. Fetch the model from a remote storage (see [Remote Storage](./model-storage.mdx#server-fetch-from-remote-storage)).

3. Load the model specified via `-m` from your local storage system.

Rasa tries to load a model in the above mentioned order, i.e. it only tries to load your model from your local
storage system if no model server and no remote storage were configured.

## Fetching Models from a Server

You can configure the HTTP server to fetch models from another URL
by adding it to your `endpoints.yml`. The server will then
reguarly query this URL for zipped models.

```yaml-rasa
models:
  url: http://my-server.com/models/default@latest
  wait_time_between_pulls: 10   # In seconds, optional, default: 100
```

:::note
If you want to pull the model just once from the server, set
`wait_time_between_pulls` to `None`.

:::

:::note
Your model server must provide zipped Rasa models, and have
`{"ETag": <model_hash_string>}` as one of its headers. Rasa will
only download a new model if this model hash has changed.

:::

Rasa sends requests to your model server with an `If-None-Match`
header that contains the current model hash. If your model server can
provide a model with a different hash from the one you sent, it should send it
in as a zip file with an `ETag` header containing the new hash. If not, Rasa
expects an empty response with a `204` or `304` status code.

An example request Rasa might make to your model server looks like this:

```bash
curl --header "If-None-Match: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" http://my-server.com/models/default@latest
```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="server-fetch-from-remote-storage"></a>

## Fetching Models from Remote Storage

You can also configure the Rasa server to fetch your model from a remote storage:

```bash
rasa run -m 20190506-100418.tar.gz --remote-storage aws
```

The model will be downloaded and stored in a temporary directory on your local storage system.

Rasa supports using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) ,
[GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) and [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) to save your models.

* Amazon S3 Storage

  S3 is supported using the `boto3` module which you can
  install with `pip install boto3`.

  Start the Rasa server with `remote-storage` option set to
  `aws`. Get your S3 credentials and set the following
  environment variables:

    * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

    * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

    * `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

    * `BUCKET_NAME`

    * `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`

  If there is no bucket with the name `BUCKET_NAME`, Rasa will create it.

* Google Cloud Storage

  GCS is supported using the `google-cloud-storage` package,
  which you can install with `pip install google-cloud-storage`.

  Start the Rasa server with `remote-storage` option set to `gcs`.

  When running on google app engine and compute engine, the auth
  credentials are already set up. For running locally or elsewhere,
  checkout their
  [client repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/master/storage/cloud-client#authentication)
  for details on setting up authentication. It involves creating
  a service account key file from google cloud console,
  and setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
  variable to the path of that key file.

* Azure Storage

  Azure is supported using the legacy `azure-storage-blob` package (v 2.1.0),
  which you can install with `pip install -I azure-storage-blob==2.1.0`.

  Start the Rasa server with `remote-storage` option set to `azure`.

  The following environment variables must be set:

    * `AZURE_CONTAINER`

    * `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

    * `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

  If there is no container with the name `AZURE_CONTAINER`, Rasa will create it.

* Other Remote Storage

  Support for other remote storages can be achieved by using an external library or implementing
  a custom module for it by extending the `rasa.nlu.persistor.Persistor` class.

  Start the Rasa server with `remote-storage` option set to the module path of model persistor.

  An example command is:

  ```bash
  rasa run --remote-storage <your module>.<class name>
  ```

Models are gzipped before they are saved in the cloud. The gzipped file naming convention
is `{MODEL_NAME}.tar.gz` and it is stored in the root folder of the storage service.
Currently, you are not able to manually specify the path on the cloud storage.

If storing trained models, Rasa will gzip the new model and upload it to the container. If retrieving/loading models
from the cloud storage, Rasa will download the gzipped model locally and extract the contents to a temporary directory.


## Fetching Models from Local Storage

If you do not configure any other storage, Rasa will try to load models from local storage.
You can specify the path to your model with the `-m` parameter:

```bash
rasa run -m models/20190506-100418.tar.gz
```

You can also specify a path to a directory instead of a specific model; Rasa will
then load the model with the latest timestamp in that directory. If you do not
specify the `-m` parameter, it will look for models in the default `models` path.
