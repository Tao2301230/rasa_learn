FAQ assistants are the simplest assistants to build and a good place to get started.
These assistants allow the user to ask a simple question and get a response. You're
going to build a basic FAQ assistant using features of Rasa designed specifically
for this type of assistant. You can handle chitchat in the same way.

In this section you will read about the following topics:

* [Responding to simple messages](./chitchat-faqs.mdx#responding-to-simple-messages)
  with the `MemoizationPolicy`

* [Handling FAQs](./chitchat-faqs.mdx#handling-faqs-using-a-response-selector)
  using a `ResponseSelector`

## Prerequisites

You should [first install Rasa](installation.mdx) and
[prototype an assistant](prototype-an-assistant.mdx) to make sure
you understand the basic concepts of intents, stories and domains.

For this tutorial, you can create a new Rasa project using the CLI:

```bash
rasa init
```

If you want to start from scratch, you should remove the default content from
the `data/nlu.yml`, `data/stories.yml` and `domain.yml` files.

## Responding to simple messages

Responding to single messages requires the assistant to recognize the message and
trigger a response.

Rasa Open Source uses what is called a `MemoizationPolicy` to
predict what it needs to do once it receives such a message.

:::note MemoizationPolicy
If the `policies` key in your `config.py` is empty (or only contains
comments) the `MemoizationPolicy` will be added automatically using
[config suggestions](model-configuration.mdx#suggested-config).
You do not need to do configure any policies.

If you customized your `policies`, you need to make sure the
[Memoization Policy](policies.mdx#memoization-policy)
is part of your configuration:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
- name: MemoizationPolicy
  max_history: 1

# ... your other policies
```

:::

### 1. Creating intents

The first step is to define the messages you want the bot to handle. You can copy
over some user message training data from Sara to train your
intents. Sara is the Rasa assistant that helps users to get started with our
Rasa products, you can find more training data to use in your projects
[here](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa-demo/blob/master/data/nlu/nlu.md).

Add the training data to your bot, you'll need to add it to the training data files:

```yaml-rasa title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - Hi
    - Hey
    - Hi bot
    - Hey bot
    - Hello
    - Good morning
    - hi again
    - hi folks

- intent: bye
  examples: |
    - goodbye
    - goodnight
    - good bye
    - good night
    - see ya
    - toodle-oo
    - bye bye
    - gotta go
    - farewell

- intent: thank
  examples: |
    - Thanks
    - Thank you
    - Thank you so much
    - Thanks bot
    - Thanks for that
    - cheers
```

### 2. Writing stories

Now that you've defined your intents, you'll need to add some [stories](stories.mdx)
for the `goodbye`, `thank` and `greet` intents.
You can add the following stories to define how the bot will respond to the intents:

```yaml-rasa title="data/stories.yml"
stories:

- story: greet           # name of the story
  steps:
  - intent: greet        # intent of the user message
  - action: utter_greet  # reaction of the bot

- story: thank
  steps:
  - intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries

- story: goodbye
  steps:
  - intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye
```

:::note Lots of intents
Do you have lots of intents that you want to respond to? In that case you should
check out [Handling FAQs](./chitchat-faqs.mdx#handling-faqs-using-a-response-selector).
You'll avoid the need to specify one story for each of your intents.
:::

You'll need to tie all these pieces together by adding the intents, actions
and responses to our [domain](domain.mdx):

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
intents:
- greet
- bye
- thank

responses:
  utter_noworries:
  - text: No worries!

  utter_greet:
  - text: Hi

  utter_bye:
  - text: Bye!
```

### 3. Using the bot
You can now train a first model and test the bot, by running the following commands:

```bash
rasa train
rasa shell
```

This bot should now be able to reply to the intents we defined consistently, and in any order.

For example:

<img alt="Memoization Policy Conversation" src={useBaseUrl("/img/memoization_policy_convo.png")} />

### 4. Testing the bot

While it's good to test the bot interactively, you should also add story tests that
can later be included as part of a [CI/CD system](./setting-up-ci-cd).
[Story tests](./testing-your-assistant#end-to-end-testing)
include user messages, bot actions and responses. This ensures that
the dialogue handling is tested as well as the message handling.
The initial project already contains test conversations, you can replace
them with some test conversations for your assistant:

```yaml-rasa title="tests/test_stories.yml"
stories:
- story: greet and goodybe
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hi!
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     Bye
    intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye

- story: greet and thanks
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hello there
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     thanks a bunch
    intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries

- story: greet and thanks and goodbye
  steps:
  - user: |
     Hey
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
     thanks you
    intent: thank
  - action: utter_noworries
  - user: |
     bye bye
    intent: bye
  - action: utter_bye
```

This test file contains three separate test stories. You can
test your bot on all of them using `rasa test`:

```bash
rasa test --stories tests/test_stories.yml
```

The test command will produce a directory named `results`. It will contain a file
called `failed_stories.yml`, where any test cases that failed will be printed. It will
also specify whether it was an NLU or Core prediction that went wrong.  As part of a
CI/CD pipeline, the test option `--fail-on-prediction-errors` can be used to throw
an exception that stops the pipeline:

```bash
rasa test --stories tests/test_stories.yml --fail-on-prediction-errors
```

## Handling FAQs using a Response Selector

When you need to handle lots of different messages like FAQs or chitchat, the above
approach using the `MemoizationPolicy` will become cumbersome. You will need to write
one story for each of the different intents.

The [ResponseSelector](components/selectors.mdx#responseselector) is designed to
make it easier to handle conversation patterns like small talk and FAQ messages.
When you use the `ResponseSelector`, you only need one story to handle all FAQs,
instead of adding one story for each intent.

:::note More details on the Response Selector

This walk through shows you how to use the response selector. If you want to know
more about how it works under the hood, head over to this [blog post](https://blog.rasa.com/response-retrieval-models/) and the
[Retrieval Actions](./retrieval-actions.mdx) page.
:::

### 1. Creating intents

People often ask Sara different questions surrounding the Rasa products, so let's
start with three intents: `ask_channels`, `ask_languages`, and `ask_rasax`.

Similar to the `MemoizationPolicy`, you'll need to define the intents and add some
training data for them:

```yaml-rasa title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: faq/ask_channels
  examples: |
    - What channels of communication does rasa support?
    - what channels do you support?
    - what chat channels does rasa uses
    - channels supported by Rasa
    - which messaging channels does rasa support?

- intent: faq/ask_languages
  examples: |
    - what language does rasa support?
    - which language do you support?
    - which languages supports rasa
    - can I use rasa also for another laguage?
    - languages supported

- intent: faq/ask_rasax
  examples: |
    - I want information about rasa x
    - i want to learn more about Rasa X
    - what is rasa x?
    - Can you tell me about rasa x?
    - Tell me about rasa x
    - tell me what is rasa x
```
:::info FAQ/ prefix
It's important that these intents have a common prefix that is separated by a `/`.
E.g. in the above example, all intents share the `faq/` prefix. This is necessary
for the intents to be recognized by the `ResponseSelector`.

:::

### 2. Creating responses

Next, you'll need to define the responses associated with these FAQs in a new
file:

```yaml-rasa title="data/responses.yml"
responses:
  faq/ask_channels:
  - text: |
      We have a comprehensive list of [supported connectors](https://rasa.com/docs/core/connectors/), but if
      you don't see the one you're looking for, you can always create a custom connector by following
      [this guide](./connectors/custom-connectors.mdx).

  faq/ask_languages:
  - text: "You can use Rasa to build assistants in any language you want!"

  faq/ask_rasax:
  - text: "Rasa X is a tool to learn from real conversations and improve your assistant. Read more [here](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/)"
```

### 3. Configuring the bot

The `ResponseSelector` should already be at the end of your pipeline configuration:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {14-15}
language: en
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
  - name: RegexFeaturizer
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
    analyzer: "char_wb"
    min_ngram: 1
    max_ngram: 4
  - name: DIETClassifier
    epochs: 100
  - name: EntitySynonymMapper
  - name: ResponseSelector
    epochs: 100
```

Now that we've defined the message handling side, we need to make
the dialogue handling parts aware of these changes. First, we need to add the
new intents to our domain:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
intents:
  - greet
  - bye
  - thank
  - faq
```

We'll also need to add a [retrieval action](./retrieval-actions.mdx),
which takes care of sending the response predicted from the `ResponseSelector`
back to the user, to the list of actions. These actions always have to start
with the `respond_` prefix:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
actions:
  - respond_faq
```

Next we'll write a story so that the dialogue engine knows which action to predict:

```yaml-rasa title="data/stories.yml"
stories:
- story: Some question from FAQ
  steps:
  - intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq
```

This prediction is handled by the `MemoizationPolicy`, as we described earlier.

### 4. Using the bot

After all of the changes are done, train a new model and test the modified FAQs:

```bash
rasa train
rasa shell
```

### 5. Testing the bot

At this stage it makes sense to add a few test cases for our conversations:

```yaml-rasa title="tests/test_stories.yml"
stories:
- story: ask channels
  steps:
  - user: |
     What messaging channels does Rasa support?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq

- story: ask languages
  steps:
  - user: |
     Which languages can I build assistants in?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq

- story: ask rasa x
  steps:
  - user: |
     What's Rasa X?
    intent: faq
  - action: respond_faq
```
### Response Selector Checklist

Using the features we described in this tutorial, you can easily build a context-less assistant.

Here's a **minimal checklist of files you need to modify** to build a basic FAQ assistant:

* `data/nlu.yml`: Add user message training data for `faq/` intents

* `data/responses.yml`: Add responses associated with `faq/` intents

* `config.yml`: Add `ResponseSelector` in your NLU pipeline

* `domain.yml`: Add a retrieval action `respond_faq` and the intent `faq`

* `data/stories.yml`: Add a simple story for FAQs

* `tests/test_stories.yml`: Add E2E test stories for your FAQs
