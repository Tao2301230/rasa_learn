This page contains information about changes between major versions and
how you can migrate from one version to another.

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="migration-to-rasa-2-0"></a>

## Rasa 1.10 to Rasa 2.0

### General

* The deprecated brokers `FileProducer`, `KafkaProducer`, `PikaProducer`
  and the `SQLProducer` have been removed. If you used these brokers in your
  `endpoints.yml` make sure to use the renamed variants instead:
  - `FileProducer` became `FileEventBroker`
  - `KafkaProducer` became `KafkaEventBroker`
  - `PikaProducer` became `PikaEventBroker`
  - `SQLProducer` became  `SQLEventBroker`

* The deprecated `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` has been removed. If you used this
  component in your `pipeline` configuration (`config.yml`) you can replace it
  with `DIETClassifier`. It accepts the same configuration parameters.

* The deprecated `KerasPolicy` has been removed. If you used this
  component in your `policies` configuration (`config.yml`) you can replace it
  with `TEDPolicy`. It accepts the same configuration parameters.

### Training data files

You can convert existing NLU and Stories training data files in the `Markdown` format
to the new `YAML` format using following commands:

```bash
rasa data convert nlu -f yaml --data={SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
rasa data convert core -f yaml --data={SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
```

Converted files will have the same names as the original ones but with a
`_converted.yml` suffix.

Please note, that it's not currently possible to convert stories that contain forms
automatically, these stories will be skipped and should be converted manually, see
`Rule Policy` below.

### Rule Policy

With the introduction of [Rules](./rules.mdx), the following policies are
deprecated:

- [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy)
- [Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy)
- [Two-Stage-Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#two-stage-fallback-policy)
- [Form Policy](./policies.mdx#form-policy)

#### Migrating from the Mapping Policy

If you previously used the [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy), you
can follow the documentation on [FAQs](./rules.mdx#faqs--mapping-intents-to-actions) to convert your mapped
intents to rules. Suppose you previously mapped an intent `ask_is_bot` as follows:

```yaml-rasa
intents:
 - ask_is_bot:
     triggers: action_is_bot
```

This becomes the following rule:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Rule to map `ask_is_bot` intent
  steps:
  - intent: ask_is_bot
  - action: action_is_bot
```

#### Migrating from the Fallback Policy

If you previously used the [Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy), the following model
configuration would translate as follows given a previous configuration like this:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
  - name: "FallbackPolicy"
    nlu_threshold: 0.4
    core_threshold: 0.3
    fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

The new configuration would then look like:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
# Other policies
- name: RulePolicy
  core_fallback_threshold: 0.3
  core_fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"

pipeline:
  # Other components
  - name: FallbackClassifier
    threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

In addition, you need to add a [Rule](./rules.mdx) to specify which action to run
in case of low NLU confidence:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Ask the user to rephrase whenever they send a message with low NLU confidence
  steps:
  - intent: nlu_fallback
  - action: utter_please_rephrase
```

Please see the [Fallback Actions](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbackactions) documentation for more
information.

#### Migrating from the Two-Stage-Fallback Policy

If you previously used the
[Two-Stage-Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#two-stage-fallback-policy), the following model
configuration would translate as follows given a previous configuration like this:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
  - name: TwoStageFallbackPolicy
    nlu_threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
    core_threshold: 0.3
    fallback_core_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    fallback_nlu_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    deny_suggestion_intent_name: "out_of_scope"
```

The new configuration would then look like:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
# Other policies
- name: RulePolicy
  core_fallback_threshold: 0.3
  core_fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"

pipeline:
  # Other components
  - name: FallbackClassifier
    threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

In addition you need to add a [Rule](./rules.mdx) to activate the Two-Stage Fallback for
messages with low NLU confidence.

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Implementation of the TwoStageFallbackPolicy
  steps:
  # This intent is automatically triggered by the `FallbackClassifier` in the NLU
  # pipeline in case the intent confidence was below the specified threshold.
  - intent: nlu_fallback
  # The Fallback is now implemented as a form.
  - action: two_stage_fallback
  - active_loop: two_stage_fallback
```

Note that the previous parameters `fallback_nlu_action_name` and
`deny_suggestion_intent_name` are no longer configurable and have the fixed values
`action_default_fallback` and `out_of_scope`.

Please see the [Fallback Actions](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbackactions) documentation for more
information.

#### Form Policy

As of Rasa Open Source 2.0 the logic for [Forms](./forms.mdx) has been moved from the
Rasa SDK to Rasa Open Source to simplify implementations of custom action libraries.
This means that you no longer need to use the `FormAction` when implementing custom
actions with the Python SDK. Instead you can use a regular `Action` to validate and
request slots.

It is now recommended to move the slot mappings from your custom action to the
[Domain](./domain.mdx) of your bot. Consider a custom form action like this:

```python

class RestaurantForm(FormAction):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "restaurant_form"

    @staticmethod
    def required_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[Text]:
        return ["cuisine"]

    def slot_mappings(self) -> Dict[Text, Union[Dict, List[Dict]]]:
        return {
            "cuisine": self.from_entity(entity="cuisine", not_intent="chitchat"),
        }

    @staticmethod
    def cuisine_db() -> List[Text]:
        """Database of supported cuisines"""

        return ["caribbean", "chinese", "french"]

    def validate_cuisine(
        self,
        value: Text,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
        """Validate cuisine value."""

        if value.lower() in self.cuisine_db():
            # validation succeeded, set the value of the "cuisine" slot to value
            return {"cuisine": value}
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_wrong_cuisine")
            # validation failed, set this slot to None, meaning the
            # user will be asked for the slot again
            return {"cuisine": None}

    def submit(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict]:
        """Define what the form has to do
            after all required slots are filled"""

        # utter submit template
        dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_submit")
        return []
```

Start the migration by adding the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) to your
model configuration:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
# Other policies
# ...
- name: RulePolicy
```

Then you need to define the form and the required slots in the domain as described in
[Forms](./forms.mdx#defining-a-form):

```yaml-rasa
forms:
  restaurant_form:
    cuisine:
    - type: cuisine
      entity: cuisine
      not_intent: chitchat
```

You don't have to add a rule for activating the form as this is already covered by your
existing stories. However, you have to add a story for handle the submission of the
form.

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Submit form
  condition:
  # Condition that form is active.
  - active_loop: restaurant_form
  steps:
  - action: restaurant_form
  - active_loop: null
  - slot_was_set:
    - requested_slot: null
  # The action we want to run when the form is submitted.
  - action: utter_submit
```

The last step is to implement a custom action to validate the form slots. Start by
adding the custom action to your domain:

```yaml-rasa
actions:
# Other actions
# ...
- validate_restaurant_form
```

Then add a custom action which validates the `cuisine` slot:

```python
class RestaurantFormValidator(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_restaurant_form"

    def run(
        self, dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher, tracker: Tracker, domain: Dict
    ) -> List[EventType]:
        extracted_slots: Dict[Text, Any] = tracker.form_slots_to_validate()

        cuisine_slot_value = extracted_slots.get("cuisine")
        validated_slot_event = self.validate_cuisine(
            cuisine_slot_value, dispatcher, tracker, domain
        )
        return [validated_slot_event]

    @staticmethod
    def cuisine_db() -> List[Text]:
        """Database of supported cuisines"""

        return ["caribbean", "chinese", "french"]

    def validate_cuisine(
        self,
        value: Text,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> EventType:
        """Validate cuisine value."""

        if value.lower() in self.cuisine_db():
            # validation succeeded, set the value of the "cuisine" slot to value
            return SlotSet("cuisine", value)
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_wrong_cuisine")
            # validation failed, set this slot to None, meaning the
            # user will be asked for the slot again
            return SlotSet("cuisine", None)
```

Please see [Forms](./forms.mdx) if you have further customizations in your
``FormAction``.

### Response Selectors

* Response Selectors are now trained on retrieval intent labels by default instead
of the actual response text. For most models, this should improve training time
and accuracy of the `ResponseSelector`.

* If you want to revert to the pre-2.0 default behavior, add the `use_text_as_label=true`
 parameter to your `ResponseSelector` component.

* All response selector related evaluation artifacts - `report.json, successes.json,
errors.json, confusion_matrix.png` now use the sub-intent of the retrieval intent as
 the target and predicted labels instead of the actual response text.
This means that the output in these files should look like -

```json title="response_selection_successes.json"
{
      "text": "Is this really legit?",
      "intent_response_key_target": "faq/is_legit",
      "intent_response_key_prediction": {
              "name": "faq/is_legit",
              "confidence": 0.88
      }
}
```

```json title="response_selection_errors.json"
{
      "text": "Is this really legit?",
      "intent_response_key_target": "faq/is_legit",
      "intent_response_key_prediction": {
              "name": "faq/ask_cost",
              "confidence": 0.6
      }
}
```

* The output schema of `ResponseSelector` has changed - `full_retrieval_intent` and `name`
have been deprecated in favour of `intent_response_key` and `response_templates` respectively.
Additionally a key `all_retrieval_intents` is added to the response selector output which will
hold a list of all retrieval intents(faq, chitchat, etc.) that are present in the training data.
An example output looks like this -

```json {3-4,10,11}
{
  "response_selector": {
    "all_retrieval_intents": [
      "faq"
    ],
    "default": {
      "response": {
        "id": 1388783286124362000,
        "confidence": 1,
        "intent_response_key": "faq/is_legit",
        "response_templates": [
          {
            "text": "absolutely",
            "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
          },
          {
            "text": "I think so."
          }
        ]
      },
      "ranking": [
        {
          "id": 1388783286124362000,
          "confidence": 1,
          "intent_response_key": "faq/is_legit"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
As a result of this, if you were previously querying for the key `full_retrieval_intent` as:
```python {2}
response_selector_output.get("default")
                        .get("full_retrieval_intent")
```
you should instead now do this:
```python {2-3}
response_selector_output.get("default")
                        .get("response")
                        .get("intent_response_key")
```

## Rasa 1.7 to Rasa 1.8

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* The [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) replaced the `keras_policy` as recommended machine
  learning policy. New projects generated with `rasa init` will automatically use
  this policy. In case you want to change your existing model configuration to use the
  [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) add this to the `policies` section in your `config.yml`
  and remove potentially existing `KerasPolicy` entries:

  ```yaml-rasa
  policies:
  # - ... other policies
  - name: TEDPolicy
    max_history: 5
    epochs: 100
  ```

  The given snippet specifies default values for the parameters `max_history` and
  `epochs`. `max_history` is particularly important and strongly depends on your stories.
  Please see the docs of the [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) if you want to customize them.

* All pre-defined pipeline templates are deprecated. **Any templates you use will be
  mapped to the new configuration, but the underlying architecture is the same**.
  Take a look at [Tuning Your Model](./tuning-your-model.mdx) to decide on what components you should use
  in your configuration file.

* The [Embedding Policy](./policies.mdx#embedding-policy) was renamed to [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy). The functionality of the policy stayed the same.
  Please update your configuration files to use `TEDPolicy` instead of `EmbeddingPolicy`.

* Most of the model options for `EmbeddingPolicy`, `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, and `ResponseSelector` got
  renamed. Please update your configuration files using the following mapping:

  |      Old model option       |                  New model option                   |

  |droprate_b                   |droprate_label                                       |
  |evaluate_every_num_epochs    |evaluate_every_number_of_epochs                      |
  |evaluate_on_num_examples     |evaluate_on_number_of_examples                       |

  Old configuration options will be mapped to the new names, and a warning will be thrown.
  However, these will be deprecated in a future release.

* The Embedding Intent Classifier is now deprecated and will be replaced by [DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier)
  in the future.
  `DIETClassfier` performs intent classification as well as entity recognition.
  If you want to get the same model behavior as the current `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, you can use
  the following configuration of `DIETClassifier`:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: DIETClassifier
    hidden_layers_sizes:
      text: [256, 128]
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    weight_sparsity: 0
    intent_classification: True
    entity_recognition: False
    use_masked_language_model: False
    BILOU_flag: False
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

  See [DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier) for more information about the new component.
  Specifying `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` in the configuration maps to the above component definition, the
  behavior is unchanged from previous versions.

* `CRFEntityExtractor` is now deprecated and will be replaced by `DIETClassifier` in the future. If you want to
  get the same model behavior as the current `CRFEntityExtractor`, you can use the following configuration:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
    features: [
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
      [
        "BOS",
        "EOS",
        "low",
        "prefix5",
        "prefix2",
        "suffix5",
        "suffix3",
        "suffix2",
        "upper",
        "title",
        "digit",
      ],
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
    ]
  - name: DIETClassifier
    intent_classification: False
    entity_recognition: True
    use_masked_language_model: False
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

  `CRFEntityExtractor` featurizes user messages on its own, it does not depend on any featurizer.
  We extracted the featurization from the component into the new featurizer [LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer](./components/featurizers.mdx#lexicalsyntacticfeaturizer). Thus,
  in order to obtain the same results as before, you need to add this featurizer to your pipeline before the
  [DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier).
  Specifying `CRFEntityExtractor` in the configuration maps to the above component definition, the behavior
  is unchanged from previous versions.

* If your pipeline contains `CRFEntityExtractor` and `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` you can substitute both
  components with [DIETClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#dietclassifier). You can use the following pipeline for that:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
    features: [
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
      [
        "BOS",
        "EOS",
        "low",
        "prefix5",
        "prefix2",
        "suffix5",
        "suffix3",
        "suffix2",
        "upper",
        "title",
        "digit",
      ],
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
    ]
  - name: DIETClassifier
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="migration-to-rasa-1-7"></a>

## Rasa 1.6 to Rasa 1.7

### General

* By default, the `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, `EmbeddingPolicy`, and `ResponseSelector` will
  now normalize the top 10 confidence results if the `loss_type` is `"softmax"` (which has been
  default since 1.3, see [Rasa 1.2 to Rasa 1.3](./migration-guide.mdx#migration-to-rasa-1-3)). This is configurable via the `ranking_length`
  configuration parameter; to turn off normalization to match the previous behavior, set `ranking_length: 0`.

## Rasa 1.2 to Rasa 1.3

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* Default parameters of `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` are changed. See
  [Components](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#embedding-intent-classifier) for details.
  Architecture implementation is changed as well, so **old trained models cannot be loaded**.
  Default parameters and architecture for `EmbeddingPolicy` are changed. See [Policies](./policies.mdx) for details.
  It uses transformer instead of lstm. **Old trained models cannot be loaded**.
  They use `inner` similarity and `softmax` loss by default instead of
  `cosine` similarity and `margin` loss (can be set in config file).
  They use `balanced` batching strategy by default to counteract class imbalance problem.
  The meaning of `evaluate_on_num_examples` is changed. If it is non zero, random examples will be
  picked by stratified split and used as **hold out** validation set, so they will be excluded from training data.
  We suggest to set it to zero (default) if data set contains a lot of unique examples of dialogue turns.
  Removed `label_tokenization_flag` and `label_split_symbol` from component. Instead moved intent splitting to `Tokenizer` components via `intent_tokenization_flag` and `intent_split_symbol` flag.

* Default `max_history` for `EmbeddingPolicy` is `None` which means it'll use
  the `FullDialogueTrackerFeaturizer`. We recommend to set `max_history` to
  some finite value in order to use `MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`
  for **faster training**. See [Featurization of Conversations](./policies.mdx#featurization-conversations) for details.
  We recommend to increase `batch_size` for `MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`
  (e.g. `"batch_size": [32, 64]`)

* **Compare** mode of `rasa train core` allows the whole core config comparison.
  Therefore, we changed the naming of trained models. They are named by config file
  name instead of policy name. Old naming style will not be read correctly when
  creating **compare** plots (`rasa test core`). Please remove old trained models
  in comparison folder and retrain. Normal core training is unaffected.

* We updated the **evaluation metric** for our **NER**. We report the weighted precision and f1-score.
  So far we included `no-entity` in this report. However, as most of the tokens actually don't have
  an entity set, this will influence the weighted precision and f1-score quite a bit. From now on we
  exclude `no-entity` from the evaluation. The overall metrics now only include proper entities. You
  might see a drop in the performance scores when running the evaluation again.

* `/` is reserved as a delimiter token to distinguish between retrieval intent and the corresponding response text
  identifier. Make sure you don't include `/` symbol in the name of your intents.

## Rasa NLU 0.14.x and Rasa Core 0.13.x to Rasa 1.0

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* The scripts in `rasa.core` and `rasa.nlu` can no longer be executed. To train, test, run, … an NLU or Core
  model, you should now use the command line interface `rasa`. The functionality is, for the most part, the same as before.
  Some changes in commands reflect the combined training and running of NLU and Core models, but NLU and Core can still
  be trained and used individually. If you attempt to run one of the old scripts in `rasa.core` or `rasa.nlu`,
  an error is thrown that points you to the command you
  should use instead. See all the new commands at [Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface.mdx).

* If you have written a custom output channel, all `send_` methods subclassed
  from the `OutputChannel` class need to take an additional `\*\*kwargs`
  argument. You can use these keyword args from your custom action code or the
  templates in your domain file to send any extra parameters used in your
  channel's send methods.

* If you were previously importing the `Button` or `Element` classes from
  `rasa_core.dispatcher`, these are now to be imported from `rasa_sdk.utils`.

* Rasa NLU and Core previously used [separate configuration files](https://legacy-docs.rasa.com/docs/nlu/0.15.1/migrations/?&_ga=2.218966814.608734414.1560704810-314462423.1543594887#id1).
  These two files should be merged into a single file either named `config.yml`, or passed via the `--config` parameter.

### Script parameters

* All script parameter names have been unified to follow the same schema.
  Any underscores (`_`) in arguments have been replaced with dashes (`-`).
  For example: `--max_history` has been changed to `--max-history`. You can
  see all of the script parameters in the `--help` output of the commands
  in the [Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface.mdx).

* The `--num_threads` parameter was removed from the `run` command. The
  server will always run single-threaded, but will now run asynchronously. If you want to
  make use of multiple processes, feel free to check out the [Sanic server
  documentation](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sanic/deploying.html#running-via-gunicorn).

* To avoid conflicts in script parameter names, connectors in the `run` command now need to be specified with
  `--connector`, as `-c` is no longer supported. The maximum history in the `rasa visualize` command needs to be
  defined with `--max-history`. Output paths and log files cannot be specified with `-o` anymore; `--out` and
  `--log-file` should be used. NLU data has been standarized to be `--nlu` and the name of
  any kind of data files or directory to be `--data`.

### HTTP API

* There are numerous HTTP API endpoint changes which can be found [here](./http-api.mdx).
