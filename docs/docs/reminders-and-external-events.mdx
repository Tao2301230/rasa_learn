The `ReminderScheduled` event and the
[trigger_intent endpoint](./http-api.mdx#operation/triggerConversationIntent) let your assistant remind you
about things after a given period of time, or to respond to external events (other applications, sensors, etc.).
[ReminderBot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/master/examples/reminderbot/README.md)
is a full example assistant that implements these features.

:::caution
Reminders don't work in request-response channels like the `rest` channel or `rasa shell`.
Custom connectors for assistants implementing reminders or external events should be built
off of the `CallbackInput` channel instead of the `RestInput` channel.

See the [reminderbot README](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/blob/master/examples/reminderbot/README.md)
for instructions on how to test your reminders locally.

## Reminders

Instead of an external sensor, you might just want to be reminded about something after a certain amount of time.
For this, Rasa provides the special event `ReminderScheduled`, and another event, `ReminderCancelled`, to unschedule a reminder.


### Scheduling Reminders

Let's say you want your assistant to remind you to call a friend in 5 seconds.
(You probably want some longer time span, but for the sake of testing, let it be 5 seconds.)
Thus, we define an intent `ask_remind_call` with some NLU data,

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: ask_remind_call
  examples: |
    - remind me to call [Albert](name)
    - remind me to call [Susan](name)
    - later I have to call [Daksh](name)
    - later I have to call [Anna](name)
```

and connect this intent with a new custom action `action_set_reminder`.
We could make this connection by providing training stories (recommended for more complex assistants),
or using [Rules](./rules.mdx).

The custom action `action_set_reminder` should schedule a reminder that, 5 seconds later,
triggers an intent `EXTERNAL_reminder` with all the entities that the user provided
in his/her last message (similar to an external event):

```python
async def run(
    self,
    dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
    tracker: Tracker,
    domain: Dict[Text, Any],
) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:
"""Schedule a reminder, supplied with the last message's entities."""

    dispatcher.utter_message("I will remind you in 5 seconds.")

    date = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=5)
    entities = tracker.latest_message.get("entities")

    reminder = ReminderScheduled(
        "EXTERNAL_reminder",
        trigger_date_time=date,
        entities=entities,
        name="my_reminder",
        kill_on_user_message=False,
    )

    return [reminder]
```

Note that this requires the `datetime` and `rasa_sdk.events` packages.

Finally, we define another custom action `action_react_to_reminder` and link it to the `EXTERNAL_reminder` intent
by writing a [Rule](./rules.mdx) for it:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Trigger `action_react_to_reminder` for `EXTERNAL_reminder`
  steps:
  - intent: EXTERNAL_reminder
  - action: action_react_to_reminder
```

This tells the model which action to take when the time is up on the reminder.

Instead of a custom action, we could also have used a simple response template.
But here we want to make use of the fact that the reminder can carry entities, and we can process the entities in this custom action.

:::caution
Reminders are cancelled whenever you shutdown your Rasa server.

### Cancelling Reminders

Sometimes the user may want to cancel a reminder that he has scheduled earlier.
A simple way of adding this functionality to your assistant is to create an intent `ask_forget_reminders`
and let your assistant respond to it with a custom action that returns the `ReminderCancelled()` event.

`ReminderCancelled()` simply cancels all the reminders that are currently scheduled.
Alternatively, you may provide some parameters to narrow down the types of reminders that you want to cancel.

* `ReminderCancelled(intent="greet")` cancels all reminders with intent `greet`

* `ReminderCancelled(entities={...})` cancels all reminders with the given entities

* `ReminderCancelled("...")` cancels the one unique reminder with the given name “`...`” that you supplied
  during its creation


## External Events

Let's say you want to send a message from some other device to change the course of an ongoing conversation.
For example, some moisture-sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi should inform your personal assistant that your favorite
plant needs watering, and your assistant should then relay this message to you.

To do this, your Raspberry Pi needs to send a message to the
[trigger_intent endpoint](./http-api.mdx#operation/triggerConversationIntent) of your conversation.
As the name says, this injects a user intent (possibly with entities) into your conversation.
So for Rasa it is almost as if you had entered a message that got classified with this intent and these entities.
Rasa then needs to respond to this input with an action such as `action_warn_dry`.
The easiest and most reliable way to connect this action with the intent is to use
[Rules](./rules.mdx).


### Responding to External Events

The first thing required to respond to an external event is the Session ID of the conversation that your
sensor should send a notification to. For example, if everyone in your office uses this Raspberry Pi to
keep track of their plants, the sensor needs to tell Rasa which user should be notified about a dehydrated plant.

Once you have your Session ID, we need to prepare the assistant so it responds to messages from the sensor.
To this end, we define a new intent `EXTERNAL_dry_plant` without any NLU data.
This intent will later be triggered by the external sensor.
Here, we start the intent name with `EXTERNAL_` to indicate that this is not something the user would say, but you can name the intent however you like.

In the domain file, we now connect the intent `EXTERNAL_dry_plant` with another custom action `action_warn_dry`
to dispatch the response to the external event to the user.

Now, when you are in a conversation with id `38cc25d7e23e4dde800353751b7c2d3e`, then running

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
  -d '{"name": "EXTERNAL_dry_plant", "entities": {"plant": "Orchid"}}' \
  "http://localhost:5005/conversations/38cc25d7e23e4dde800353751b7c2d3e/trigger_intent?output_channel=latest"
```

in the terminal will cause your assistant to say “Your Orchid needs some water!”.
