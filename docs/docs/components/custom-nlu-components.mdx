description: Create custom components to create additional features like sentiment analysis to integrate with open source bot framework Rasa.
---

You can create a custom component to perform a specific task which NLU doesn't currently offer (for example, sentiment analysis).
Below is the specification of the [`rasa.nlu.components.Component`](./components/custom-nlu-components.mdx#rasa.nlu.components.Component) class with the methods you'll need to implement.

:::note
There is a detailed tutorial on building custom components [here](https://blog.rasa.com/enhancing-rasa-nlu-with-custom-components/).

:::

You can add a custom component to your pipeline by adding the module path.
So if you have a module called `sentiment`
containing a `SentimentAnalyzer` class:

```yaml-rasa
pipeline:
- name: "sentiment.SentimentAnalyzer"
```

Also be sure to read the section on the [Component Lifecycle](../tuning-your-model.mdx#component-lifecycle).

To get started, you can use this skeleton that contains the most important
methods that you should implement:

```python (docs/sources/tests/nlu/example_component.py)
```

:::note
If you create a custom tokenizer you should implement the methods of `rasa.nlu.tokenizers.tokenizer.Tokenizer`.
The `train` and `process` methods are already implemented and you simply need to overwrite the `tokenize`
method.

:::

:::note
If you create a custom featurizer you can return two different kind of features: sequence features and sentence
features. The sequence features are a matrix of size `(number-of-tokens x feature-dimension)`, e.g.
the matrix contains a feature vector for every token in the sequence.
The sentence features are represented by a matrix of size `(1 x feature-dimension)`.
