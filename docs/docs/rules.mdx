Rasa rules are a type of training data used to train Rasa's dialogue management models.
Rules describe parts of conversations that should always follow the same path.
Useful applications for rules are for example:

* **FAQs**: FAQs are questions that users ask independent of the current context.
  Rules are an easy way to specify fixed answers to these questions.

* [Fallback Actions](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbackactions): Users might confront your assistant with unexpected messages.
  The messages will typically receive low intent confidence.
  You can use the [FallbackClassifier](./components/intent-classifiers.mdx#fallbackclassifier)
  in combination with rules to treat messages with low NLU confidence like an FAQ.

* [Forms](./forms.mdx): It's a common use case for assistants to collect form-like
  data from the user. Both activation of forms and handling of unexpected
  events as part of a form will often follow fixed paths.

**Don't overuse rules**. Rules are great to handle small specific conversation parts but
unlike [Stories](./stories.mdx) rules don't have the power to generalize to unseen conversation
paths. Combine rules and stories to make your assistant robust and able to handle
real user behavior.

## Writing a Rule

Before you start writing rules, you have to make sure that the
[Rule Policy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) is added to your model configuration:

```yaml-rasa
policies:
- ... # Other policies
- name: RulePolicy
```

Rules can then be added to the `rules` section of your training data.

To indicate that a rule can apply at any point in a conversation, start with the
intent which starts the conversation and then add the actions which your assistant
should perform in response to that.

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Say `hello` whenever the user sends a message with intent `greet`
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

This example rule applies at the start of conversation as well as when the user decides
to a send a message with an intent `greet` in the middle of an ongoing conversation.

### Rules for the Conversation Start

To write a rule which only applies at the beginning of a conversation, add a
`conversation_start: True` to your rule:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Say `hello` when the user starts a conversation with intent `greet`
  conversation_start: True
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

If a user starts by sending a message with an intent other than `greet`, and sends a
message with intent `greet` later in the conversation, the rule will not match.

### Rules with Pre-Conditions

Rules can describe requirements which have to be fulfilled for the rule to be
applicable. To do so, add any information about the prior conversation, under the
`condition`:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Only say `hello` when the user provided a name
  condition:
  - slot_was_set: 
    - user_provided_name: true
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

### Skip Waiting for User Input at the End of a Rule

By default, rules will wait for the next user message when finished with the last step:

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Rule which will wait for user message when it was applied
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  # Every rule implicitly includes a prediction for `action_listen` as last step.
  # This means that Rasa Open Source will wait for the next user message.
  - action_listen
```

If you want to hand over to another story or rule, add `wait_for_user_input: False`
to your rule.intent This indicates that the assistant should execute another action
before waiting for more user input.

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Rule which will not wait for user message once it was applied
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  wait_for_user_input: False
```

### Rules and Forms

When a [Form](./forms.mdx) is active, rules become applicable again if

- the form filled all required slots
- the form rejected its execution (see
[Handling unhappy paths](./forms.mdx#writing-stories--rules-for-unhappy-form-paths) for
 more details)

## Use Cases

This section explains common use cases of rules.

### FAQs / Mapping Intents to Actions

Some messages do not require any context to answer them. Common examples are either FAQs
or triggers which are sent by [Reminders and External Events](./reminders-and-external-events.mdx).

To map an intent to a certain action, you need to define a
[Rule](./rules.mdx).
The following example always responds with an action `utter_greet` in case the user
greets the assistant.

```yaml-rasa
rules:

- rule: Say `hello` whenever the user sends a message with intent `greet`
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

### Failing Gracefully

Handling unknown messages gracefully is key to a successful assistant. As unknown
messages can happen at any time in a conversation, they are a special case of
[FAQs](./rules.mdx#faqs--mapping-intents-to-actions). Please see the docs on
[Fallback Actions](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbackactions) for different ways to
handle fallbacks gracefully.

### Forms

Use [Forms](./forms.mdx) if you need to collect multiple pieces of information from a user
before being able to process their request. A common example for this is booking a table
at a restaurant which requires information like name, number of people, and time.
