You first have to create a Microsoft app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Running on Microsoft Bot Framework

If you want to connect to the botframework input channel using the
run script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

you need to supply a `credentials.yml` with the following content:

```yaml-rasa
botframework:
  app_id: "MICROSOFT_APP_ID"
  app_password: "MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD"
```
