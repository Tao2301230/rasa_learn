You first have to create a mattermost app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Getting Credentials

Mattermost now uses bot accounts for better security.  So you can use their guide to create
your bot to get your token required for the credentials.yml file.

For more information on creating a bot account please see
[Bot Creation](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/bot-accounts.html#bot-account-creation).

For information on converting existing user account into bot account please see
[User Conversion](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/bot-accounts.html#how-do-i-convert-an-existing-account-to-a-bot-account).

**How to set up the outgoing webhook:**

1. To create the Mattermost outgoing webhook, login to your Mattermost
   team site and go to **Main Menu > Integrations > Outgoing Webhooks**.

2. Click **Add outgoing webhook**.

3. Fill out the details including the channel you want the bot in.
   You will need to ensure the **trigger words** section is set up
   with `@yourbotname` so that the bot doesn't trigger on everything
   that is said.

4. The **Content Type** must be set to `application/json`.

5. Make sure **trigger when** is set to value
   **first word matches a trigger word exactly**.

6. The callback url needs to be either your localhost address for Rasa, or your ngrok url where you
   have your webhook running in Core or your public address, e.g.
   `http://test.example.com/webhooks/mattermost/webhook` or `http://localhost:5005/webhooks/mattermost/webhook`.

For more detailed steps, visit the
[Mattermost docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/developer.html).

## Running on Mattermost

If you want to connect to the Mattermost input channel using the
run script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

you need to supply a `credentials.yml` with the following content:

```yaml-rasa
mattermost:
  url: "https://chat.example.com/api/v4"
  token: "xxxxx" #  the token for the bot account from creating the bot step.
  webhook_url: "https://server.example.com/webhooks/mattermost/webhook"
```

The endpoint for receiving Mattermost channel messages
is `/webhooks/mattermost/webhook`, the same as `webhook_url` here. You should
add this url also in the Mattermost outgoing webhook.
