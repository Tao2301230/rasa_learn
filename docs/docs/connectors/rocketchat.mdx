## Getting Credentials

**How to set up Rocket.Chat:**

1. Create a user that will be used to post messages, and set its
   credentials at credentials file.

2. Create a Rocket.Chat outgoing webhook by logging in as admin to
   Rocket.Chat and going to
   **Administration > Integrations > New Integration**.

3. Select **Outgoing Webhook**.

4. Set **Event Trigger** section to value **Message Sent**.

5. Fill out the details, including the channel you want the bot
   listen to. Optionally, it is possible to set the
   **Trigger Words** section with `@yourbotname` so that the bot
   doesn't trigger on everything that is said.

6. Set your **URLs** section to the Rasa URL where you have your
   webhook running in Core or your public address with
   `/webhooks/rocketchat/webhook`, e.g.
   `http://test.example.com/webhooks/rocketchat/webhook`.

For more information on the Rocket.Chat Webhooks, see the
[Rocket.Chat Guide](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/integrations/).

## Running on RocketChat

If you want to connect to the Rocket.Chat input channel using the run
script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

you need to supply a `credentials.yml` with the following content:

```yaml-rasa
rocketchat:
  user: "yourbotname"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  server_url: "https://demo.rocket.chat"
```
