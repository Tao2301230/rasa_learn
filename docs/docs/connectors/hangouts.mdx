## Hangouts Chat Setup

This channel works similar to the standard Rasa REST channel. For each request from the channel, your bot will
send one response. The response will be displayed to the user either as text or a so-called card (for
more information, see the Cards section).

In order to connect your Rasa bot to Google Hangouts Chat, you first need to create a project in
Google Developer Console that includes the Hangouts API. There you can specify your bot's endpoint
and also obtain your project id, which determines the scope for the OAuth2 authorization in case you
want to use OAuth2. The Hangouts Chat API sends a Bearer token with every request, but it is up to
the bot to actually verify the token, hence the channel also works without this.
For more information see the official Google resources [https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat).

The possibility to implement asynchronous communication between Hangouts Chat and bot exists, but due
to the usually synchronous nature of Rasa bots, this functionality is not included in this channel.

### Running On Hangouts Chat

If you want to connect to Hangouts Chat using the run script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

you don't need to supply a `credentials.yml`.

If you want to use OAuth2, simply put the project id obtained from the Google Developer Console into it.

```yaml-rasa
hangouts:
  project_id: "12345678901"
```

The endpoint for receiving Hangouts Chat messages is
`http://localhost:5005/webhooks/hangouts/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values. Hangouts Chat only forwards
messages to endpoints via `https`, so take appropriate measures to add
it to your setup.

### Cards and Interactive Cards

There are two ways in which Hangouts Chat will display bot messages, either as text or card. For each recevied
request, your bot will send all messages in one response. If one of those messages is a card (e.g. an image),
all other messages are converted to card format as well.

Interactive cards trigger the `CARD_CLICKED` event for user interactions, e.g. when a button is clicked. When
creating an interactive card, e.g. via `dispatcher.utter_button_message()` in your `actions.py`, you can
specify a payload for each button that is going to be returned with the `CARD_CLICKED` event and extracted
by the `HangoutsInput` channel (for example
`buttons=[{"text":"Yes!", "payload":"/affirm"}, {"text":"Nope.", "payload":"/deny"}])`.
Updating cards is not yet supported.

For more detailed information on cards, visit the
[Hangouts docs](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference).

### Other Hangouts Chat Events

Except for `MESSAGE` and `CARD_CLICKED`, Hangouts Chat knows two other event types, `ADDED_TO_SPACE` and
`REMOVED_FROM_SPACE`, which are triggered when your bot is added or removed from a direct message or chat room
space. The default intent names for these events can be modified in the `HangoutsInput` constructor method.
