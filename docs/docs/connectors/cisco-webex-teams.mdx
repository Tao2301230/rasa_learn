description: Build a Rasa Chat Bot on Cisco Webex

You first have to create a cisco webex app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Getting Credentials

**How to get the Cisco Webex Teams credentials:**

You need to set up a bot. Check out the Cisco Webex for Developers
[documentation](https://developer.webex.com/docs/bots) for information
about how to create your bot.

After you have created the bot through Cisco Webex Teams, you need to create a
room in Cisco Webex Teams. Then add the bot in the room the same way you would
add a person in the room.

You need to note down the room ID for the room you created. This room ID will
be used in `room` variable in the `credentials.yml` file.

Please follow this link below to find the room ID
`https://developer.webex.com/endpoint-rooms-get.html`

## Running on Cisco Webex

If you want to connect to the `webexteams` input channel using the run
script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

you need to supply a `credentials.yml` with the following content:

```yaml-rasa
webexteams:
  access_token: "YOUR-BOT-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  room: "YOUR-CISCOWEBEXTEAMS-ROOM-ID"
```

The endpoint for receiving Cisco Webex Teams messages is
`http://localhost:5005/webhooks/webexteams/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values. This is the URL
you should add in the OAuth & Permissions section.

:::note
If you do not set the `room` keyword
argument, messages will by delivered back to
the user who sent them.
