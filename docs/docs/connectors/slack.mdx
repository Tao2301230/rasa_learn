description: Build a Rasa Chat Bot on Slack

You first have to create a Slack app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Getting Credentials

**How to get the Slack credentials:** You need to set up a Slack app.

1. To create the app go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click
   on **Create New App**.

2. Activate the following features:

* Interactivity & Shortcuts > Interactivity (if your bot uses any [interactive components](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/interactive-components) , e.g. buttons)

* Add your Rasa request URL `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/slack/webhook`, replacing
  the host and port with the appropriate values that point to your Rasa X or Rasa Open Source deployment.

* Event subscriptions > Subscribe to bot events: `message.channels`, `message.groups`, `message.im`, `message.mpim`

* App Home > Always Show My Bot as Online

1. Get the `Bot User OAuth Access Token` from the OAuth & Permissions page. Click `Install App to Workspace`
   and allow access to your workspace. You will need
   to provide this value in your credentials later in these instructions. It should start
   with `xoxb`.

2. In the “OAuth & Permissions > Redirect URLs” enter the endpoint for receiving Slack messages. This is
   the same URL you entered above for Interactivity & Shortcuts - `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/slack/webhook`.

3. Go to the “Event Subscriptions” section, turn on the “Enable Events” and add the endpoint here also.

For more detailed steps, visit the
[Slack API docs](https://api.slack.com/events-api).

## Running on Slack

If you want to connect to the slack input channel using the run
script, e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run
```

Do not forget to run the action server if this is required by your bot,
e.g. using:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

You need to supply a `credentials.yml` with the following content:

* The `slack_channel` can be a channel or an individual person that the bot should listen to for communications, in
  addition to the default behavior of listening for direct messages and app mentions, i.e. “@app_name”. To get the channel
  id, right click on the channel choose Copy Link and the id will be the last component in the URL.

* Use the entry for `Bot User OAuth Access Token` in the
  “OAuth & Permissions” tab as your `slack_token`. It should start
  with `xoxb`.

* Optional: You can add a `proxy` through which to route outgoing traffic to the Slack API. Only HTTP proxies are currently supported.

```yaml-rasa
slack:
  slack_token: "xoxb-286425452756-safjasdf7sl38KLls"
  slack_channel: "C011GR5D33F"
  proxy: "http://myProxy.online"  # Proxy Server to route your traffic through. This configuration is optional.
  slack_retry_reason_header: "x-slack-retry-reason"  # Slack HTTP header name indicating reason that slack send retry request. This configuration is optional.
  slack_retry_number_header: "x-slack-retry-num"  # Slack HTTP header name indicating the attempt number. This configuration is optional.
  errors_ignore_retry: None  # Any error codes given by Slack included in this list will be ignored. Error codes are listed [here](https://api.slack.com/events-api#errors).
  use_threads: False  # If set to True, bot responses will appear as a threaded message in Slack. This configuration is optional and set to False by default.
```

The endpoint for receiving slack messages is
`http://localhost:5005/webhooks/slack/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values. This is the URL
you should add in the “OAuth & Permissions” section as well as
the “Event Subscriptions”.
