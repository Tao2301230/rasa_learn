## Using Interactive Learning

Interactive learning makes it easy to write stories by talking to your bot and providing feedback.
This is a powerful way to explore what your bot can do, and the easiest way to fix any mistakes
it makes. One advantage of machine learning-based dialogue is that when
your bot doesn't know how to do something yet, you can just teach it!

In Rasa Open Source, you can run interactive learning in the command line with 
[`rasa interactive`](./command-line-interface.mdx#interactive-learning).
[Rasa X](http://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x) provides a UI for interactive learning, and you can use any user conversation
as a starting point. See [Talk to Your Bot](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/user-guide/share-assistant/#talk-to-your-bot)
in the Rasa X docs.
