The configuration file defines the NLU and Core components that your model will use. The
`language` and `pipeline` keys specify how the NLU model should be built. You can
learn about choosing components for your NLU pipeline [here](./tuning-your-model.mdx). The
`policies` key defines the [policies](./policies.mdx) that the Core model will
use.

## Suggested Config

You always need to specify the `language` key in your `config.yml` file with the
2-letter ISO language code.

The two other keys (`pipeline` and `policies`) can be left out or left empty. When
running `rasa train`, the Suggested Config feature will select a default configuration
for the missing key(s) which will then be used to train the model.

Please note, that only the default configuration for `pipeline` will be automatically selected
if you run `rasa train nlu`, and only the default configuration for `policies`
will be selected if you run `rasa train core`.

Example `config.yml` file:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/example_for_suggested_config.yml)
```

The selected configuration will also be written as comments into the `config.yml` file,
so you can see which configuration was used. For the example above, the resulting file
might look e.g. like this:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/data/configs_for_docs/example_for_suggested_config_after_train.yml)
```

If you like, you can then un-comment the suggested configuration for one or both of the
keys and make modifications. Note that this will disable automatic suggestions for this
key when training again.
As long as you leave the configuration commented out and don't specify any configuration
for a key yourself, a default configuration will be suggested whenever you train a new
model.
