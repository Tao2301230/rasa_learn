## Default Actions

The available default actions are:

|                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|`action_listen`                  |Stop predicting more actions and wait for user input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|`action_restart`                 |Reset the whole conversation. Can be triggered during a conversation by entering `/restart` if the [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy) is included in the policy configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|`action_session_start`           |Start a new conversation session. Take all set slots, mark the beginning of a new conversation session and re-apply the existing `SlotSet` events. This action is triggered automatically after an inactivity period defined by the `session_expiration_time` parameter in the domain's [Session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-config). Can be triggered manually during a conversation by entering `/session_start`. All conversations begin with an `action_session_start`. |

All the default actions can be overridden. To do so, add the action name
to the list of actions in your domain:

```yaml-rasa
actions:
- action_default_ask_affirmation
```

Rasa will then call your action endpoint and treat it as every other
custom action.

## Customizing Default Actions

<a aria-hidden="true" tabIndex="-1" className="anchor enhancedAnchor" id="custom-session-start"></a>

In order to overwrite a default action, write a custom action whose `name()` method
returns the same name as the default action in the table above.
Explicitly add this action to the `actions:` section of your domain file to tell Rasa
to use your custom action instead of the default action when that action name is called.

### Customizing the session start action

The default behavior of the session start action is to take all existing slots and to
carry them over into the next session. Let's say you do not want to carry over all
slots, but only a user's name and their phone number. To do that, you'd override the
`action_session_start` with a custom action that might look like this:

```python
from typing import Text, List, Dict, Any

from rasa_sdk import Action, Tracker
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet, SessionStarted, ActionExecuted, EventType
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher


class ActionSessionStart(Action):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "action_session_start"

    @staticmethod
    def fetch_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[EventType]:
        """Collect slots that contain the user's name and phone number."""

        slots = []

        for key in ("name", "phone_number"):
            value = tracker.get_slot(key)
            if value is not None:
                slots.append(SlotSet(key=key, value=value))

        return slots

    async def run(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[EventType]:

        # the session should begin with a `session_started` event
        events = [SessionStarted(metadata=self.metadata)]

        # any slots that should be carried over should come after the
        # `session_started` event
        events.extend(self.fetch_slots(tracker))

        # an `action_listen` should be added at the end as a user message follows
        events.append(ActionExecuted("action_listen"))

        return events
```
