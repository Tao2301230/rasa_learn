description: Find out how open source chatbot framework Rasa allows you to stream events to a message broker.
---

An event broker allows you to connect your running assistant to other services that process the data coming
in from conversations. For example, you could [connect your live assistant to
Rasa X](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/installation-and-setup/deploy#connect-rasa-deployment/)
to review and annotate conversations or forward messages to an external analytics
service. The event broker publishes messages to a message streaming service,
also known as a message broker, to forward Rasa [Events](./events.mdx) from the Rasa server to other services.

## Format

All events are streamed to the broker as serialized dictionaries every time
the tracker updates its state. An example event emitted from the `default`
tracker looks like this:

```json
{
    "sender_id": "default",
    "timestamp": 1528402837.617099,
    "event": "bot",
    "text": "what your bot said",
    "data": "some data about e.g. attachments"
    "metadata" {
          "a key": "a value",
     }
}
```

The `event` field takes the event's `type_name` (for more on event
types, check out the [Events](./events.mdx) docs).

## Pika Event Broker

The example implementation we're going to show you here uses
[Pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io) , the Python client library for
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com).

### Adding a Pika Event Broker Using the Endpoint Configuration

You can instruct Rasa to stream all events to your Pika event broker by adding an `event_broker` section to your
`endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/data/test_endpoints/event_brokers/pika_endpoint.yml)
```

Rasa will automatically start streaming events when you restart the Rasa server.

### Adding a Pika Event Broker in Python

Here is how you add it using Python code:

```python
from rasa.core.brokers.pika import PikaEventBroker
from rasa.core.tracker_store import InMemoryTrackerStore

pika_broker = PikaEventBroker('localhost',
                              'username',
                              'password',
                              queues=['rasa_events'])

tracker_store = InMemoryTrackerStore(domain=domain, event_broker=pika_broker)
```

### Implementing a Pika Event Consumer

You need to have a RabbitMQ server running, as well as another application
that consumes the events. This consumer to needs to implement Pika's
`start_consuming()` method with a `callback` action. Here's a simple
example:

```python
import json
import pika


def _callback(self, ch, method, properties, body):
        # Do something useful with your incoming message body here, e.g.
        # saving it to a database
        print('Received event {}'.format(json.loads(body)))

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # RabbitMQ credentials with username and password
    credentials = pika.PlainCredentials('username', 'password')

    # Pika connection to the RabbitMQ host - typically 'rabbit' in a
    # docker environment, or 'localhost' in a local environment
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(
        pika.ConnectionParameters('rabbit', credentials=credentials))

    # start consumption of channel
    channel = connection.channel()
    channel.basic_consume(_callback,
                          queue='rasa_events',
                          no_ack=True)
    channel.start_consuming()
```

## Kafka Event Broker

It is possible to use [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) as main broker for your
events. In this example we are going to use the [python-kafka](https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage.html) library, a Kafka client written in Python.

### Adding a Kafka Event Broker Using the Endpoint Configuration

You can instruct Rasa to stream all events to your Kafka event broker by adding an `event_broker` section to your
`endpoints.yml`.

Using `SASL_PLAINTEXT` protocol the endpoints file must have the following entries:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/data/test_endpoints/event_brokers/kafka_plaintext_endpoint.yml)
```

If using SSL protocol, the endpoints file should look like:

```yaml-rasa (docs/sources/data/test_endpoints/event_brokers/kafka_ssl_endpoint.yml)
```

### Adding a Kafka Broker in Python

The code below shows an example on how to instantiate a Kafka producer in you script.

```python
from rasa.core.brokers.kafka import KafkaEventBroker
from rasa.core.tracker_store import InMemoryTrackerStore

kafka_broker = KafkaEventBroker(host='localhost:9092',
                                topic='rasa_events')

tracker_store = InMemoryTrackerStore(domain=domain, event_broker=kafka_broker)
```

The host variable can be either a list of brokers addresses or a single one.
If only one broker address is available, the client will connect to it and
request the cluster Metadata.
Therefore, the remain brokers in the cluster can be discovered
automatically through the data served by the first connected broker.

To pass more than one broker address as argument, they must be passed in a
list of strings. e.g.:

```python
kafka_broker = KafkaEventBroker(host=['kafka_broker_1:9092',
                                      'kafka_broker_2:2030',
                                      'kafka_broker_3:9092'],
                                topic='rasa_events')
```

### Authentication and Authorization

Rasa's Kafka producer accepts two types of security protocols - `SASL_PLAINTEXT` and `SSL`.

For development environment, or if the brokers servers and clients are located
into the same machine, you can use simple authentication with `SASL_PLAINTEXT`.
By using this protocol, the credentials and messages exchanged between the clients and servers
will be sent in plaintext. Thus, this is not the most secure approach, but since it's simple
to configure, it is useful for simple cluster configurations.
`SASL_PLAINTEXT` protocol requires the setup of the `username` and `password`
previously configured in the broker server.

```python
kafka_broker = KafkaEventBroker(host='kafka_broker:9092',
                                sasl_plain_username='kafka_username',
                                sasl_plain_password='kafka_password',
                                security_protocol='SASL_PLAINTEXT',
                                topic='rasa_events')
```

If the clients or the brokers in the kafka cluster are located in different
machines, it's important to use ssl protocol to assure encryption of data and client
authentication. After generating valid certificates for the brokers and the
clients, the path to the certificate and key generated for the producer must
be provided as arguments, as well as the CA's root certificate.

```python
kafka_broker = KafkaEventBroker(host='kafka_broker:9092',
                                ssl_cafile='CARoot.pem',
                                ssl_certfile='certificate.pem',
                                ssl_keyfile='key.pem',
                                ssl_check_hostname=True,
                                security_protocol='SSL',
                                topic='rasa_events')
```

If the `ssl_check_hostname` parameter is enabled, the clients will verify
if the broker's hostname matches the certificate. It's used on client's connections
and inter-broker connections to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Implementing a Kafka Event Consumer

The parameters used to create a Kafka consumer are the same used on the producer creation,
according to the security protocol being used. The following implementation shows an example:

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
from json import loads

consumer = KafkaConsumer('rasa_events',
                          bootstrap_servers=['localhost:29093'],
                          value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')),
                          security_protocol='SSL',
                          ssl_check_hostname=False,
                          ssl_cafile='CARoot.pem',
                          ssl_certfile='certificate.pem',
                          ssl_keyfile='key.pem')

for message in consumer:
    print(message.value)
```

## SQL Event Broker

It is possible to use an SQL database as an event broker. Connections to databases are established using
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), a Python library which can interact with many
different types of SQL databases, such as [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html),
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and more. The default Rasa installation allows connections to SQLite
and PostgreSQL databases, to see other options, please see the
[SQLAlchemy documentation on SQL dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/dialects/index.html).

### Adding a SQL Event Broker Using the Endpoint Configuration

To instruct Rasa to save all events to your SQL event broker, add an `event_broker` section to your
`endpoints.yml`. For example, a valid SQLite configuration
could look like the following:

```yaml-rasa
event_broker:
  type: SQL
  dialect: sqlite
  db: events.db
```

PostgreSQL databases can be used as well:

```yaml-rasa
event_broker:
  type: SQL
  url: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5432
  dialect: postgresql
  username: myuser
  password: mypassword
  db: mydatabase
```

With this configuration applied, Rasa will create a table called `events` on the database,
where all events will be added.
