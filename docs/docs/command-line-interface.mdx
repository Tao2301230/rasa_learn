## Cheat Sheet

The command line interface (CLI) gives you easy-to-remember commands for common tasks.

## rasa init

A single command sets up a complete project for you with some example training data.

```bash
rasa init
```

This creates the following files:

```bash
.
├── __init__.py
├── actions.py
├── config.yml
├── credentials.yml
├── data
│   ├── nlu.yml
│   └── stories.yml
├── domain.yml
├── endpoints.yml
├── models
│   └── <timestamp>.tar.gz
└── tests
   └── test_stories.yml
```

The `rasa init` command will ask you if you want to train an initial model using this data.
If you answer no, the `models` directory will be empty.

With this project setup, common commands are very easy to remember.
To train a model, type `rasa train`, to talk to your model on the command line, `rasa shell`,
to test your model type `rasa test`.

## rasa train

The main command is:

```bash
rasa train
```

This command trains a Rasa model that combines a Rasa NLU and a Rasa Core model.
If you only want to train an NLU or a Core model, you can run `rasa train nlu` or `rasa train core`.
However, Rasa will automatically skip training Core or NLU if the training data and config haven't changed.

`rasa train` will store the trained model in the directory defined by `--out`. The name of the model
is per default `<timestamp>.tar.gz`. If you want to name your model differently, you can specify the name
using `--fixed-model-name`.

The following arguments can be used to configure the training process:

```text [rasa train --help]
```

:::note
Make sure training data for Core and NLU are present when training a model using `rasa train`.
If training data for only one model type is present, the command automatically falls back to
`rasa train nlu` or `rasa train core` depending on the provided training files.

:::

## rasa interactive

To start an interactive learning session with your assistant, run

```bash
rasa interactive
```

If you provide a trained model using the `--model` argument, the interactive learning process
is started with the provided model. If no model is specified, `rasa interactive` will
train a new Rasa model with the data located in `data/` if no other directory was passed to the
`--data` flag. After training the initial model, the interactive learning session starts.
Training will be skipped if the training data and config haven't changed.

During the interactive learning, Rasa will plot the current conversation
and a few similar conversations from the training data to help you
keep track of where you are. You can view the visualization at
[http://localhost:5005/visualization.html](http://localhost:5005/visualization.html)
as soon as you've started interactive learning.
This plotting can take some time; to skip the visualization, run `rasa interactive --skip-visualization`.


The full list of arguments that can be set for `rasa interactive` is:

```text [rasa interactive --help]
```

## rasa shell

This command allows you to talk to your assistant. To start a chat session
with your assistant on the command line, run:

```bash
rasa shell
```

The model that should be used to interact with your bot can be specified by `--model`.
If you start the shell with an NLU-only model, `rasa shell` allows
you to obtain the intent and entities of any text you type on the command line.
If your model includes a trained Core model, you can chat with your bot and see
what the bot predicts as a next action.
If you have trained a combined Rasa model but nevertheless want to see what your model
extracts as intents and entities from text, you can use the command `rasa shell nlu`.

To increase the logging level for debugging, run:

```bash
rasa shell --debug
```

:::note
In order to see the typical greetings and/or session start behavior you might see
in an external channel, you will need to explicitly send `/session_start`
as the first message. Otherwise, the session start behavior will begin as described in
[Session configuration](./domain.mdx#session-config).

:::

The full list of options for `rasa shell` is:

```text [rasa shell --help]
```

## rasa run

To start a server running your Rasa model, run:

```bash
rasa run
```

By default the Rasa server is using HTTP for its communication. To secure the communication with
SSL and run the server on HTTPS, you need to provide a valid certificate and the corresponding
private key file. You can specify these files as part of the `rasa run` command.
If you encrypted your keyfile with a password during creation,
you need to add the `--ssl-password` as well.

```bash
rasa run --ssl-certificate myssl.crt --ssl-keyfile myssl.key --ssl-password mypassword
```

The following arguments can be used to configure your Rasa server:

```text [rasa run --help]
```

For more information on the additional parameters, see [Model Storage](./model-storage.mdx).
See the Rasa [HTTP API](./http-api.mdx) docs for detailed documentation of all the endpoints.

## rasa run actions

To run your action server run

```bash
rasa run actions
```

The following arguments can be used to adapt the server settings:

```text [rasa run actions --help]
```

## rasa visualize

To open a browser tab with a graph showing your stories:

```bash
rasa visualize
```

Normally, training stories in the directory `data` are visualized. If your stories are located
somewhere else, you can specify their location with `--stories`.

Additional arguments are:

```text [rasa visualize --help]
```

## rasa test

To evaluate your model on test data, run:

```bash
rasa test
```

Specify the model to test using `--model`. The above command will test your model
end-to-end using test stories. You can evaluate the dialogue and nlu
model separately using
```bash
rasa test core
```
and

```bash
rasa test nlu
```

Check out more details in
[Evaluating an NLU Model](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#evaluating-an-nlu-model) and
[Evaluating a Core Model](./testing-your-assistant.mdx#evaluating-a-core-model).

The following arguments are available for `rasa test`:

```text [rasa test --help]
```

## rasa data split

This commands allows you to create a train-test split of your training data. To
create a split of your NLU data, run:

```bash
rasa data split nlu
```

You can specify the training data, the fraction, and the output directory using
the following arguments:

```text [rasa data split nlu --help]
```

This command will attempt to keep the proportions of intents the same in train and test.
If you have NLG data for retrieval actions, this will be saved to seperate files:

```bash
ls train_test_split

      nlg_test_data.yml     test_data.json
      nlg_training_data.yml training_data.json
```

## rasa data convert

You cam convert NLU data from
- LUIS data format,
- WIT data format,
- Dialogflow data format,
- JSON, or
- Markdown

to
- YAML or
- JSON or
- Markdown.

You can start the converter by running:

```bash
rasa data convert nlu
```

You can specify the input file, output file, and the output format with the following arguments:

```text [rasa data convert nlu --help]
```

## rasa export

To export events from a tracker store using an event broker, run:

```bash
rasa export
```

You can specify the location of the environments file, the minimum and maximum
timestamps of events that should be published, as well as the conversation IDs that
should be published.

```text [rasa export --help]
```

## rasa x

Rasa X is a toolset that helps you leverage conversations to improve your assistant.
You can find more information about it <a className="reference external" href="https://rasa.com/docs/rasa-x/" target="_blank">here</a>.You can start Rasa X locally by executing

```bash
rasa x
```

To be able to start Rasa X you need to have Rasa X local mode installed
and you need to be in a Rasa project.

:::note
By default Rasa X runs on the port 5002. Using the argument `--rasa-x-port` allows you to change it to
any other port.

:::

The following arguments are available for `rasa x`:

```text [rasa x --help]
```
