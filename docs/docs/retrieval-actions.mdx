description: Use a retrieval model to select chatbot responses in open source bot framework Rasa.
---

Retrieval actions are designed to make it simpler to work with small talk and simple questions.
For example, if your assistant can handle 100 FAQs and 50 different small talk intents, you can use a single retrieval
action to cover all of these.
From a dialogue perspective, these single-turn exchanges can all be treated equally, so this simplifies your stories.

Instead of having a lot of stories like:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: weather
  steps:
  - intent: ask_weather
  - action: utter_ask_weather

- story: introduction
  steps:
  - intent: ask_name
  - action: utter_introduce_myself

# ...
```

You can cover all of these with a single story where the above intents are grouped
under a common `chitchat` intent:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: chitchat
  steps:
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: respond_chitchat
```

A retrieval action uses the output of a [ResponseSelector](./components/selectors.mdx#responseselector) component from NLU which learns a
retrieval model to predict the correct response from a list of candidate responses given a user message text.

actions for handling single turn interactions.

## Training Data

Like the name suggests, retrieval actions learn to select the correct response from a list of candidates.
As with other message data, you need to include examples of what your users will say in
your training data file:

```yaml-rasa title="data/nlu.yml"
nlu:
- intent: chitchat/ask_name
  examples: |
    - what's your name
    - who are you?
    - what are you called?

- intent: chitchat/ask_weather
  examples: |
    - how's weather?
    - is it sunny where you are?
```

First, all of these examples will be combined into a single `chitchat`
retrieval intent that NLU will predict. All retrieval intents have a suffix
added to them which identifies a particular response key for your assistant, in the
above example - `ask_name` and `ask_weather`. The suffix is separated from
the intent name by a `/` delimiter.

Next, include response texts for all retrieval intents in a training data file:

```yaml-rasa title="data/responses.yml"
responses:
  chitchat/ask_name:
  - text: "my name is Sara, Rasa's documentation bot!"

  chitchat/ask_weather:
  - text: "it's always sunny where I live"
```

:::info Responses format
The responses use the same format as the [responses in the domain](responses.mdx).
This means, you can also use buttons, images and any other multimedia elements in
your responses.
:::

The retrieval model is trained separately as part of the NLU training pipeline
to select the correct response. The default configuration uses the user message text as input and the retrieval intent combined with the
response key suffix (e.g. `chitchat/ask_name`) as the correct label for that user message. However, the
retrieval model can also be configured to use the text of the response message as the label by setting `use_text_as_label`
to `True` in the component's configuration. In that case, if you change the text of these responses,
you have to retrain your retrieval model! This is a key difference to the responses defined in
your domain file.

:::note Special meaning of `/`
As shown in the above examples, the `/` symbol is reserved as a delimiter to separate
retrieval intents from response text identifier. Make sure not to use it in the
name of your intents.

## Configuration File

You need to include the [ResponseSelector](./components/selectors.mdx#responseselector)
component in your configuration. The component needs a tokenizer, a featurizer and an
intent classifier to operate on the user message before it can predict a response
and hence these components should be placed before `ResponseSelector` in the
NLU configuration. An example:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
```

## Domain

Rasa uses a naming convention to match a retrieval intent name, e.g. `chitchat`,
to its corresponding retrieval action.
The correct action name in this case is `respond_chitchat`.
The prefix `respond_` is mandatory to identify it as a retrieval action.
Another example - the correct action name for `faq` would be `respond_faq`.
To include this in your domain, add it to the list of actions:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
actions:
  # ...
  - respond_chitchat
  - respond_faq
```

A simple way to ensure that the retrieval action is predicted after the chitchat
intent is to use [Rules](./rules.mdx).
However, you can also include this action in your stories.
For example, if you want to repeat a question after handling chitchat:

```yaml-rasa title="data/stories.yml" {6-8}
stories:
- story: interruption
  steps:
  - intent: search_restaurant
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
  - intent: chitchat
  - action: respond_chitchat
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
```

## Multiple Retrieval Actions

If your assistant includes both FAQs **and** chitchat, it is possible to
separate these into separate retrieval actions, for example having sub-intents
like `chitchat/ask_weather` and `faq/returns_policy`. Rasa supports adding multiple `RetrievalActions`
like `respond_chitchat` and `respond_faq`. To train separate retrieval models for each of the retrieval intents,
you need to include a separate `ResponseSelector` component in the config for each retrieval intent:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8-12}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
  retrieval_intent: "faq"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
  retrieval_intent: "chitchat"
```

Alternatively, if you want the retrieval actions for both the intents to share a single retrieval model,
specifying just one `ResponseSelector` component is enough.

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml" {8}
language: "en"

pipeline:
- name: "WhitespaceTokenizer"
  intent_split_symbol: "_"
- name: "CountVectorsFeaturizer"
- name: "DIETClassifier"
- name: "ResponseSelector"
```


## Under the hood: Parsing Response Selector Output

The parsed output from NLU will have a property named `response_selector`
containing the output for each response selector component. Each response selector is
identified by `retrieval_intent` parameter of that response selector
and stores two properties:

* `response`: The predicted response key under the corresponding retrieval intent,
prediction's confidence and the associated response templates

* `ranking`: Ranking with confidences of top 10 candidate response keys.

Example result:

```json
{
    "text": "How's the weather today?",
    "response_selector": {
      "faq": {
        "response": {
          "id": 1388783286124361986,
          "confidence": 0.7,
          "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_weather",
          "response_templates": [
            {
              "text": "It's sunny in Berlin today",
              "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
            },
            {
              "text": "I think it's about to rain."
            }
          ]
         },
        "ranking": [
          {
            "id": 1388783286124361986,
            "confidence": 0.7,
            "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_weather"
          },
          {
            "id": 1388783286124361986,
            "confidence": 0.3,
            "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_name"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
}
```

If the `retrieval_intent` parameter of a particular response selector was left to its default value,
the corresponding response selector will be identified as `default` in the returned output.

```json {4}
{
    "text": "How's the weather today?",
    "response_selector": {
      "default": {
        "response": {
          "id": 1388783286124361986,
          "confidence": 0.7,
          "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_weather",
          "response_templates": [
            {
              "text": "It's sunny in Berlin today",
              "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
            },
            {
              "text": "I think it's about to rain."
            }
          ]
         },
        "ranking": [
          {
            "id": 1388783286124361986,
            "confidence": 0.7,
            "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_weather"
          },
          {
            "id": 1388783286124361986,
            "confidence": 0.3,
            "intent_response_key": "chitchat/ask_name"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
}
```
